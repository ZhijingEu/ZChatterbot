Hi
Oh, hello there
Hey
Yoyoyo
Wassaaaap
Hey
What's new?
Not much same same
How are you
Meh. OK I guess
How's the food ?
I dunno. Heard it was alright
Have you been here before ?
I don't think so. Have you ?
How have you been ?
Eh.So so.
Can you think ?
Sure - can you ?
What is the problem?
Problem - no problem
What is the matter?
Nothing's the matter. Why do you ask ?
Give me the VIR
OK bawse - it's 0.9. If you cut back on the project team limo maybe we can shift it to 1.0
What is the VIR ?
For now it's 0.5 but if you can approve my leave next week who knows...
VIR now !
Harap maaf , nombor yang anda hubungi tiada dalam perkhidmatan - doot doot doot doot doot
Tell me my VIR
It's 1.1 but if you take away the unjustified sense of optimism and incorporate the fact that the impending singularity of the robot uprising - it goes to 0.2.
Tell me the VIR
It's 1.0 but if you take away the unjustified sense of optimism and incorporate the fact that the impending singularity of the global climate system collapse - it goes to 0.1.
I need the VIR urgently
OK ! I need a holiday urgently ! How is 0.7 ? What about 0.9 ? Can I take leave now ???!
Annual review is tomorrow at 10.30. . If u can’t make it I will send u the minutes
Yes pls. A bit too last min. I thought it was later. I hv another mtg for my current job at 10 to 1130.
No pb
Wish that guyk told me earlier. At one point i thought he said maybe move to early Apr.

Hey
Coming. . I am having bfast with that dude before the meeting if u want to join. At SF
I just arrived. You already started the mtg ? Which room ?
Hey. . Me and that guy got the tender discussion. During your hsse colo thing. I suggest u rope in that guy for that discussion with that weird  lady. I can scour the colo contract and epcm. But the extend of the colo has many aspects. . . . . . 
Nobody fwded the tender discussion invite to me ??so i didnt even know.
U want to go ?. . I can fwd to u. I am not sure if u are taking over it
Yes pls. that guyk didnt mention but would assume so.
Monday half day 9 until 12. . Ok
Ohno. That clashes w a mtg i hv w that company at their offices at 11am onwards too.
Attend the 9-10 enough alr. . Coz it’s same thing for the 2 vendors. We are going to brief them the changes
Anything i need to prep for the CRMM discussion ?. Forgot to ask
Nothing. . This is on Nov. that guy. Coz he has the history. For u is more of FYI. I think I forwarded the sheet but am resending it to you. Hi Zhi- this deli2go digital menu- is it part of your capex ?. Hi Zhi. Prob need you to just hv a look at the kpi scorecard. I found some errors and they have rectified. My worry is on how they calculate it as none of us had time to properly verify it .. The kpi signoff would hv some bonus payable to that company
Ok. Will make time to look at it properly.
Is there a planned safety day at site?. . Pls let me know so I can join
Oh yes. Wait i fwd. I will be at that place.
Ok pls do. . Cp is encouraged to join at site. So will just join yours
Ah. K
Is there a calendar invite ?. . I might need to forward to that madam
No invite yet. Just that mail.. that guyk and I are in L34 MR09
Ok coming. . Hey. Where is the meeting ya. Zhi- what was the meeting u need me to attend on a Friday 11th morning f. . . . . . . . 
Monthly capex.
Ah ok so that poor fellow hasn’t move that yet. . Ok got it
Hey. Just trying to keep up w mails. What is status on TK tender ? I'm a bit out of the loop - Anything i need do to help move this since that dood still out and that guyk is already bz w his new job...
Ah. . Waiting for that guy to rectify his VIR- I spoke to him few days back , he was suppose to get that done yesterday but I think he is bz with safety day
Ok. Anything outstanding from that company that guy  or that gal ?
that gal hasn’t come back on the cost of that place land vendor obligation bit. . Let me
I think that guy  tired of my face oledi. He owes me a heap of things. The thing is he doesnt seem to delegate. Everything also he is directly involved.
I think coz he is the only one who can do some of these work. . Unfortunately. But he is normally very responsive
I see u writing mails past midnight also this wk.
Yea - it’s a norm for some of us hahah
Apparently nobody sleeps in retail
Upstream also !. . Zamir’s farewell last night. U know he is leaving Shell?
I cannot keep up w whatsapps chat groups. Ppl hv looped me into multiple ones.. Yes. Joining pemandu kan?
Actually I don’t keep groups as it is not official platform. . So I rejected some of the groups. So everyone no choice hv to email me. Especially vendor related. . . . . . . . 
Yes but ppl happily added me in and some are mix of that company and even l3s (pca)
I don’t actually. . Internal shell I am ok. But that also limited. Yes joining pemandu. Marcus farewell too but is he just moving role. . . . . . . 
Where to? Markus Ngu issit?
Yeah
The one reporting to your friend last time
Yes
I am so overdue for lunch catch up w her.
It’s not so bad in upstream izzit ?. . I hv the Diebold Nixdorf tender that is giving me sleepless nights. And the colo partners stuff - it’s the only NFR whatsapp group I hv. As there are many many partnership we are moving into. . . . . . . . 
Maybe in the ops side same but in that other place there is bit more structure and clear cut process for decision making and who does what
Hence that weird  lady’s hsse stuff is very very crucial but she is very very blur. . We hv more and more stuff - Lazada express , laundry , 3M
Wah laundry ?
So scary right
Got space ar?
Got - only 4 sets
They normally hv masdive back rooms. *massive*
But it’s the safety part. . Lazada also we are very scared. At least I am. Dunno what parcel may come in. . . . . . . . 
But we hv courier svc clip in somewhere already no ?. I thought i saw or was that another oil co
That’s the post ezibox and mbe. . Petronas also has those. There is a 9am challenge session on Monday for 3M with joari - for Waja Retail. Are u involved in Waja Retail issue. . . . . . . . 
No. I know we were asking for more money even though work ongoing already. This is the kota dsara site doing shop upgrade yes?. Wasnt invited/copied. What's the issue
Yes. . Then I think forget it -. ??. It’s sat u better rest. . . . . . . . 
Ok tx. Hv good wkd yourself.
Lunch with your friend next week together. . I see her everyday
Ok. Maybe Thu or Fri.. Mon tue no good for me
Ok. . Btw the corrosion test and tank camera inspection. that other company keep taichi-ing amongst themselves. Have u got Tanknology’s quote. There was an issue actually last week but I felt did not need to include you but best as FYI to u. . . . . . . 
Yes.
Gerald Lim. . He mention to someone and went to that lady
About ?
About a supplier visit to china. . Without cp involvement. After a bit of checking
Huh ?
It was actually for modular. . With idx. And loke went - I think that guy suppose to go but visa rejected. Possibly they will implement it in Malaysia. Hv already told that guy. Qualification of suppliers including visits if done by Shell hv to include cp (Syafril for global) , and the global folks including himself can’t qualify the supplier then pass them off to that company. that company also has their own supplier qualification. Idea is not to hv shell do own qualification unless it’s global initiative then Syaf has to be involved. I know that guy is pushing for modular for Starbucks via c&t through Pca. So need to be cautious. . 
Yes. I am aware of that. Apparently starbucks not receptive
Gerald is global alliance and format manager btw. . Just hv to make sure all processes are covered as u just don’t know who will rat on who. But that doodefit of the doubt I think Gerald is just concerned about not having a cp to keep things in check. Can u send me tanknologt quo. . . . . . . . 
Done
<Media omitted>. . Let me go and getthat weirdo coz nobody to pick him up. See u there. Zhi- can I understand why is the LOA signed by you?. Is it normally signed by that guy ?. . . . . . . 
I dunno. that dood said i sign so i thought i sign. Not sure.
You don’t have MOA wor and shouldn’t it be agreed with da boss first ?. . Has he agreed
No havent briefed him. Letters haven't gone out yet i think so got chance to stop it.. Good point.
Let me be the baddie. . I replied
Aiya u so fast. I was writing my reply halfway. Thx.
Hahahah. . U just second my email. That would reinforce it coz that dood normally will retaliate ahhaha. He doesn’t like to follow rules. . . . . . . . 
He follows the money!
But we did agree yesterday to brief through da boss first
He seems very driven and ambitious
He is - and it’s a good thing. . We r just the check and balance. We just gotta get this right coz there will be phase 2. He is alr asking to skip more processes. Thanks Zhi u are a saviour. . . . . . . 
Was in same mtg anyway so took chance to talk to him
Did u all manage to engage da boss on the award for the Turnkey
U ard ? Skype or u want to come to l34.
Skype better. . I got a 10.30 call right after. Trying to Churn the contract. Is Vinesh with u f2f?. sent the strategy paper to u alr, i've update it. *updated. . . . . . 
Ok. Let me review tmrw. Do we need Vinesh's updated quote to round it off or not necessary?
yes. . i need it to update the paper. let me do it. then u review the final draft. before i send it to bawse and that madam. . . . . . . 
K. Sorry realise i was looking at the other mail u sent at 10am. Not the updated one. Too many mails.
oh. . :). Stay positive Zhi??. Can I tell u a joke. that dude just called me - he is in the meeting withthat weirdo from that company. He ask me to attend - when I couldn’t he said he needs me to SCOLD that weirdo. . . . . 
Isthat weirdo the punchline?
The joke is on us. . I alr wrote to the team that dude and that company thet some of the rates are contractual. I think that dude is taking everyone around the taman. He passed the phone to him for me to scold him like as if he is my child. . . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
Zhi is our meeting on ?
Sorry. Guess not. http://www.belbin.com/about/belbin-team-roles/. <Media omitted>. <Media omitted>. This was my 2ndary trait. <Media omitted>
Need to pay to assess izzit
<Media omitted>
Hmm. . I have done this sort of thing and I feel it is much better to have few people to assess me rather than I assess myself. Am due to send you my performance feedback btw. You hv to assess me. That sly cow. . . . . . . 
?. <Media omitted>. Isnt the expression sly dog right ?. <Media omitted>
Ahhaha. . Sly bitch
Sly cow better. Fits with risk of potential bu11$h1t
??. Enjoy the weekend before all the bullshit starts again on Monday. . Do u remember. If it was Hadri or KimBok who suggested to fast track for the 2 sites for submission. Vinesh claimed that it was Hadri who suggested it. He wants to talk to me now but I said tomorrow morning. . . . . . . 
I think he may be right. Hadri did come up w the idea...
????????. . I remember Hadri asking what we can do with the 2 sites and Kim Bok suggesting that we could to fast track
TRUE
<Media omitted>. . havent called him yet. Missed voice call. Nothing in the contract or parent contract. On anti poaching. But we must not play any part directly or indirectly to help poor lady get the job. She must resign and apply accordingly. Pls letthat other galknow. We must not be seen to instigate the employment. It would be unethical. Unless this is done. 
Ili used employee referral program.??. But said she spoke to that dude a few mths back on this and he was not against it.
Omg la
These AO enagements are painful. that other company info not reliable for AI CM project nominations.
Ahaha ahaha. . Persevere and just plough through
Plough makes me think of beast of burden.. Hee haw
Why is a beast of burden a donkey and not cow ? I was suggesting u to persevere and work like a cow. . Meeting at 2pm is on?. I tot u are at the lrlt. that dood said there is little progress yet as there isn’t even IP for the Turnkey. Also I spoke to Nadia about the TNB agreement and she said if Anna doesn’t want to do it she is happy to take it on. . . . . . . 
Super
I will set up the meeting. . But I hv given her all that you gave me. And the doc I sent to Anna. All to Nadia alr. . . . . . . . 
Tx. I wish i went straight to her in first placs. *place
By work scope. . Should be anna. But if she taichi. I tot I better get Nadia. She is more willing to do it. After I share the background. When u hv time I share more with u ahhahaha. . . . . 
The CoLo TK one even if no IP -wasnt any prelim work done?
Lunch when u free. . Only a bit. They need to do some prelim work before they can submit IP
<Media omitted>. Felt sympathetic to his kidney stones issue
How come u saved his name as Vinesh Beca ( that was his old company). . And u spelt Pram’s name wrongly ??
Its ok.that other galthinks you are TzeLin and i was Tzi for first 4 wks.
I know. . And note is very professionally written- controlled pissed off mode
Yes. Now very careful. Should show u what happened when i did site visit..... <Media omitted>. I wrote to that dude. Mana tau he fwd to that dude and PJC direct. ??????
i think. . u need to use plain-er english with that company and that dude. i feel they dont understand your english. this one is more of that dude's blunder but you were quick to be that guye to him and say it's alright. . . . . . . . 
My engrish too england izit?
u talk too fast and too canggih vocab. . if u notice msot of the time only I can understand u sometimes
I should just leave and go into academia ??
why not. . it's not a bad profession- education
??????. vs current job
true but. . it's a much more fulfilling job
Grass always greener. On the udder side. ??. Milking the puns
hahah
My england too power ?
milk it while it's good. . so anything groundbreaking from the LRLT lab
Well have to live w bullshit so might as well enjoy it.
i had an issue today
I dunno. I hv no point of reference to compare
i dont want to drown u. . no point of reference of what's groundbreaking and what's not?. but the shop fitting tender. that guy  called me about the roundel. the signage for the deli2go and that coffee co (the round ones). the one u see at Gold Droplet site. confusion on whether this is a GFA RVIe item or not, so i resent to them the RVIe standards that does not include the Roundel. . . . . 
We want to change design to make brighter
he mentioned that guy andthat other galwent to Octagon Maju to check. . so i thought i had better check with that guy
And....
coz i dunno if he's submitted it for approval to the GFA/global team. . he said there is pressure now to make that part of the GFA RVIe scope. but as of today, nothing has been submitted to GC and nothing's done, so i considered this as no man's land and up for any supplier to grab
Aiyo. Ok leaving this alone because i can use the that guy approved this excuse only once.
but... . then as i look into the BOQ that that gal sent out
Current assume not until told otherwise
i saw that Shop Fascia was included and that's GFA RVIE item!. . which means we are in breach if we let Octagon supply that, so. i might hv to ask that gal to carve that out. that guy went further to ask. if i've looked at the specifications, whether it was clearly articulated on the design/specs, e.g thickness of paint coating. countertop detailing. . . . . . 
Ok. Do it.. Wait. I call. Txt not efficient
eh dont. . wait wait. i'm multitasking. i cant talk and type. to multiple people. . . . . . . 
OK. Problem is specs are moving target.
<Media omitted>
Ili dowan to sign until a few more elements sorted. I know but above is latest draft. Overall still not signed off.
so we're doing a tender without all elements firmed firhgt
Yes.
that's ok. . best thing is. that guy said they may hv to do a global tender. for certain items. . . . . . . . 
Althoughthat other galwill argue that most are ok already
and i was saying to him. . if the global tender carves out the important elements, like countertop and racking. what is the local market suppliers going to makan. worst is that if PCA get the global contract for shop fittings. likely they will because they are willing to throw price. . . . . . . 
Hmmmm.
so i told that guy. . this local tender we are doing is only good for another year. like wtf. i said why u global people need to kacau our local tenders. he said some countries hv challenges folowing the specs. we dont even hv the specs to begin with and a global tender will not solve the problem. . . . . . 
Tender even more
then he said indonesia cannot get any local supplier because it is imported from china. . then i said yeahla, in the end all buy from china. pca has an office there. then all go to pca. . . . . . . . 
So how? Let that company just jalan dulu or tell them not worth the effort?
i'm going to eff it. . eff the global people. we just jalan
I hv the that company stamped and initialed hardcopy contract
Yes I heard
How to pass to you? U leave ke?
I will get it from you tomorrow. . Tomorrow le. No worries
Ok.i am in Penang area office
Oh!
I pass to Salhah on my floor
I am in bidor actually ahhahha. . Ok. I will get it from her
I am mtg that company at 2-3pm on Bingobox wthat other galon Tezz and maybe Alpha Energy. U want to join towards last 15min? Ref your mail to that dude.
U mean at site ?
No they coming here. They took pictures of site and hopefully got layout too.. Was meant to be techn mtg on what mods needed at shop
What about Scientific Retail. . Are they gonna be there ?
No. We kept them out
Ok
Ili's suggestion
I see
As was meant for what we do at the shop. Which they hv lno inbolvement in.. *no. *involvement
U mean Scientific Retail has no involvement ?. . Confused already- tell me in simple English ahhaha. Can’t pick up call. Am multitasking. Teaching bahasa to my son. . . . . . . 
that company scope will be to do the shop modifications.  scientific retail isn't involved in that.
Ok got it. . Can you send me the invite
However I am still unclear on scientific retail's exact scope
I will somehow make it there
that dude will be coming to our office is at 3 p.m. anyway
They supply and install the entire thing
Will they be doing the permitting and any cabling works that lead up to the box as well
That was the deal lor. . They do permitting and install including cabling work. I would treat it like a colo clip out
What is there is a need to do some sort of work to prepare the location that we will be putting it on eg if we choose the surface that is turfed. Ok. Clear
They need to go for hsse briefing. . Submit layout drawing. Including m&e
Anyway like I were saying that dude is coming tomorrow to our offices because there's a meeting with CB Richard Ellis around the fire that happened today at the site in subang
Omg. . Was there a fire
May not be a bad idea for us to talk to that dude anyway. Yes welcome to my fantastic world
Omg. . Which site. I hope it’s not near my house. Cause of fire??. . . . . . . . 
Electrical fire at the chiller
Let him lead this le . This Bingobox is small project
Related to a shop upgrade but that company says that he didn't modify anything in the chiller they only reocated it
Bet that other company also says the same lor/ not their fault
Joari DM very concerned
Another quality issue
I've been up in the north today with Lucy and her team
Lucy is that guye
I am probably at the final straws of my tolerance for nonsense in this role
Lol. . I think so too. It’s been getting more and more nonsensical. Even for me. Believe me. that guy also had his moments where he raise his voice. To the business. Not just that company. . . . 
This job is a joke and I'm not quite sure what I'm learning. The sad part is that despite of all this this job actually does nothing for my resume. Assuming that is that I'm trying to get back into major oil and gas or infrastructure projects
If it doesn’t do anything for you and it’s becoming unmeaningful daily I think it’s really time to go. . How to go to work everyday. What happened - was it something in the north - what was the final straw that broke the camel’s back. No such thing as final straw*s*. . . . . . . . 
Sorry missed Security Guard mtg. Had to prioritise other things
No worrie. . They still gotta give me the justification in accordance to what we are spending now. 100K Savings only
U also going Titan ke?
Yes. . See u there. Am going to see their warehouse system. I am already here actually. Let me know when u arrive. . . . . . . 
With Sam from that company at pkdr SS6. Coming soon
K. . Who is sam
Field supervisor
Forgot
I have checked that the colo partners actually have a submeter for electricity of which the retailer will then charge the colo partners
Every month. . So by right we should be able to get a separate utility bill from
Cant make it for shop fitting tender tmrw. Need to see a doctor. I had a boil on my chin that I scratched. I think now infected as it has been painful whole day.
No worries. . Will update u
K
Any message u want me to deliver. . U will make it to the atg pilot call right?
Will hv to see.. <Media omitted>. From See. Biz as usual ?
Lol. . I will dial in just to see the monkey show
Ok. May dial in too.. Assuming i can see thr derma first thing in morning.. For tmrw on Sunway CoLo pls convey my views that. Why did that company wait so long to do this retender as they already knew that the foundation design was going to change.
Sigh. . I am
ow
Conveying our pain today. . Of having to “project manage “. <Media omitted>. Sent him this. Pressure him a bit. . . . . . . 
In principle no issue as long as stays in the budget but I remember budget was only 2m MYR per site. If MRR2 and Sunway Mentari > 2m each how are you going to balance the books when they still one more site unless SH Sentul McD is  cheaper
They will need to check against IP
*there is still one more site
Sigh
Ask them if they Sentul colo is in time to combine with this one or there will be a separate exercise ?
Will ask them tomorrow
Sorry. I can dial in for part of session maybe. Doc opens only at 10am
No worries. . It’s probably going to be another dud meeting. Dud and duh meeting
Better a dud than explosive no?
I rather it explodes. . Waiting for u to explode actually
Nah. I will fizzle out
I can’t be the one exploding
Not explody type
??. . Every meeting is a dud with that company - honestly it’s less so with my other suppliers
that poor fellow forgot to send the one pager summary thing as part of the mthly capex mtg. What was it called again.. CPI?
Yes. . The pack was sent ?
You know the one i am referring to. Is it called CPI ?
yes. . I know. It’s cpi
Morning Zhi.. just capping our discussion yesterday on solar tommy team... let me know if I missed out anything... l ' bragging rights' as 1 st to implement..... nternal meeting next week with LSD and Jee Hun for us to discuss prior to seeing Shell .... Can help me sense check. This was from TNB dude
Who is this from. . Seems ok. What is SP. Nirinder right. What is section 29 of the act. . . . . . . 
Yes Nirinder.. I need to check what Section 29 is too.. Uncomfortable he said i _agreed_ though
??????. . Play by ear then
<Media omitted>. <Media omitted>
Lol
Does that dude normally cite dictionary or is this my "lecturer" style unfortunately influencing him?
No. . This is the first time ever !. GC’s Quran thing was just too funny and it wasn’t even a good metaphor
Yes. Luckily no muslims in room
Did u get a response on vertex about ppc
I may hv a minor medical isdue. The spot on my chin for sure infected.. Will u be there tmrw for that company thing.
I will. . Is that guy there ?
I might need to do dial in plus halway. who knows
Ahhahha. . Let me ask him?
Sure why not. He wont make it. Its 930am
Hahaha
At least not f2f. So same as me dialing in...
In that case , maybe hv everyone to just dial in ?. . Wouldn’t that be easier. Am sure they don’t want to come all the way to just see my face ??
Yes. Will msg Pram. I saw him today. He wanted to come f2f. You frightened that dude ?. Island elong
Yes. . Ask him to do homework. Coz as I think about this
Do u hv Pram mobile no
Wah. . I don’t think so. Wait
His sign off only show office. I left his card at work. Not sure to reach him
Nvm. . I will just plonk him in the room
Haiyo. Ok see how. Kinta is booked anyway.
Yeah la
You will seethat other galat Linggi doing mindfulness traing
No problem for me to just escort him
Dunno how she carved out time to do it.
What is that ???. . Mindfulness training ??
My good fren is the external facilitator
What the hell is that
Mindfulness https://g.co/kgs/pGd69r
Is this like yoga ?
Sorta. Meditation more like. that dude today oledi so stress. The island elong thing going to kill him
It’s not the first time. . I think though
He whatsapp me to let me knoe hes on it
Would like to know how that dude claw back the 1M
that dude and i gave See a few chances already. Painfully
So See did mention some of these things before
He arrange multiple rounds of session where he went line item by item w pcc. And then that company. And then Titan
that dude or See
that dude
Wasn’t see wirh him. . See wasn’t with him?
Yes. But in the end he let that dude take over driver seat
Anyway I told that dude to prepare with his rebuttal
We gave See 1-2mths to settle it himself but no movement
Sigh. . Can’t be helped then. He is also in Jakarta now
His rebuttal was oh VO related to TM or dealer req scope changes.
We spoke to Vinesh about this before. . Having MY staff supporting other programs
This was before we found out so much value left on table. He is bck tonight. SS6pkdr reopening tomolo
We are due to do CRMM. . Client Relationship Management Matrix something like that
Not crummy
Where u two can score each other based on the relationship. . Hahaha
crummy. of poor quality.
It is sort of crummy. . U haven’t got tomorrow’s pre read right
This job or maybe scenarios the job has to deal with is stupid. U shld see if PT got job for you. U put in so many hrs am sure u could do an equiv of your friend job if get past techn jargon
????. . That’s what your friend says. I am a chemical engineer
I thought pre read was last wk minutes
So tech jargons are ok for me. . Afraid it might be too hard for me in upstream
No but when ppl spout nonsense about DP2 vessel and petronas ptcam etc and other upstream bullshit. Takes time to get adjusted
??
that dude also challenged sie selection
Another 1.5 years. . Aiya. That fella
Who?
Empty vessel only. . that dude. Did he tell u why he challenged it
No that is why i tried to invite him. He wrote short mail. The one attached
Let’s see if he can articulate it
I did google map search of sites he chosem. He has a point. All the ones chosen are big big. Maube we need a smaller more rundown ones. Tg sepat represent sites wuth big land but we build small footprint. Raja muda musa klang represent most sites with small plots 2 pump island. Dengkil represent small land with huge volume. Sg besi represent sites within buulding. Bukit cheras represent sites with layout issue.
Fair enough. . He didn’t explain why he propose those sites. This could go on and on. Perhaps the planners / engineering should pick the sites instead what is the most representative. . . . . . . . 
I know. Part of challenge is availability of good archived data.
Isn’t it then even worse for pram and gang
Ultimately need to link back 7 sites to 700 others
They don’t even know
Yes
We may get stuck here
I know
I would pick the planners and that dude’s brains. . Make them give it to u. And end this shenanigans. ??. . . . . . . . 
Yes if i can time to even go toilet or hv lunch in between mtgs
Lol
that guy must hv been master of delegating , pushing back , deferment/delaying and straight uo ignoring
He is like u. . In some bits
How did he do this job. Which bits?
Though he often scolds people likethat other galand that weird  lady
I dont scold them. Got ar?
He came to a point where he was more blunt to them. . Not really. U try to be reasonable. that guy gone past being reasonable with them. Coz they are bit duh to him. So he just outright tell them straight NO. . . . . . 
that weird  lady worse.that other galis smart
I dunno. . I worked with everyone almost.that other galis fast. Think that guy was just more blunt after a while. Coz he cannot deal with all the nonsense. And it will keep coming. . . . . . 
I am there already
So he just put up I am an asshole front. . U haven’t seen how Fuels marketing work. It’s worse
Whatever 1-2 things i clear today will just be replaced by 3-4 other things tmrw. I hv been dealing w Chang hwee and Yee Von
Das?
Yes. Vroom
Yee Von told me. . Working wirh that company. She executed. Executes. chang hwee I dunno. He was my stakeholder for some time. He has issues. . . . . 
Betul ke? Former banker
Yes. . Depression. So he can’t handle stress
Wah i think i can be chairman of club
Glad to pass it to june now , my new cp colleague. . U can’t
No?
Chang hwee is the president
Really that bad?
He often would leave me. . On my own to deal with his stuff. So glad our project got cancelled
I am already borderline snapping at everyone
Hahahha I know. . That was how that guy was like. He only looks chill. He was doing the same as u. . . . . . . . 
Although u think i an still very civil. And polite
Sometimes only. . U were sarcastically civil to GC yesterday. I tot it was funny
I think he did not pick it up
I think he heard u say “stupid”. . I had that funny feeling too. U almost need to just tell him out right. I often do that to him. . . . . . . . 
He is literal minded type
No need to mince my words. . He can take it. And yet he will keep asking me things. Because in the past that guy will not talk to him. I was their mediator. . . . . . . 
Not one for complex abstractions but good at bullheaded stubborness. Anyway. To bed now
Adios
I was about to write a short thank you note to that company yep and team but thought maybe should check with you first whether their reply was too vague
Yes it is vague. . I called him. Don’t bother to reply. He said. That the flushing before installation is up to the ffs. Or the pcc. I asked him to write a clthat guyication email but we may need to cough it out from him. Did u see the MOA email. No need to ask Shivani. We all refer to the same thing. . 
Just following CK's lead. It seemed like he was being purposely ambiguous
Yes. . He was. He is also blur- own MOA also tak tau. Do we have our 4pm meeting today. U r offline. U r not on mc , are u?. Your voice is breaking. . . . . 
Just checking. Hv we shared the green banding eval xlsx template w Dover / Tokheim ? Do they know that is how we will green band them.... Assume Hamid has set up an agenda and not just we turn up and they blur blur.. ??
No we don’t hv to give it to them
I think we will hv a fun time. He didnt seem to even have asked to clthat guyy what we wanted to do which either means he is super prepared or has no clue.
I did tell him. . Dunno he heard me or not
Omg. This bongobox jalan or not.
Sigh
Reading the mails now
Fuck it. . I push it back to ili
Wah. 4 letter words keluar oledi.
On the Ethics and Compliance thing. . Lol. If u notice u hv been swearing a lot too
Where the fuck got
Lol. . Downstream is bad for u
Ahahahaha *sigh*
Swearing is my natural state
I cannot keep up.. Not the swearing. The job i mean
Really. . It doesn’t seem so
Feels like that.. Anyway. C u tmrw.. What language is this _get our business to pursue the counterparty to officiated corporate ownership by third parties asap then_ .. Bahasa GSS ?
Ohhhhh. . This one. Actually they just need the letter with the shareholders information be certified as a true copy by a third party like legal. Btw. that dude wants me to check if you can hv dinner on thurs. Wtf u didn’t see that other fellow’s email to me and ili. “Can both of you please clthat guyy and follow through?”. Kena gasak by Kannan then pass it on to us. . . . 
I was just w him this morning. So strange that need to go thru you summore. I think cannot. Ive been away a lot last few weeks for area office engagememts.
Shy la maybe
<Media omitted>. <Media omitted>. Apparently it is Be Positive
Lol. . Too funny
I thought it was their performance target. Ie they aim for only B+
Then it should be A positive
End up C-
See Minus. . Tell See that
Hahaha. I think the fella now under pressure
I m sure. . U called ?. Very noisy here
We may run 15m late. Let hamid know?. I am w gary & that dude
Sure. . that guy has started alr. Paperwork audit
Omg thisthat weirdo.
Ahhaa
Hope i hv not left value on table by being explicit only on pipe line flushing. Are the other calibration and mobilisation signif?. In relative terms
No I don’t think so
Mcm arrangement and Calibration is not the same scope ?
Not the same
U whacking him now izzit. He just let go mobilisation...
Ahhaa. . Think I am so powerful meh. I alr whack him when u had your call with that guy
He just resent email. Claiming only MCM Arrangement and Calibration.
He wasn’t willing. . Yes. Very little money only. He shouldn’t charge for mobilisation la. . . . . . . . 
Let go Mobilisation and pipeline flushing. Sly cow afraid of you mar
What about mcm fees. . So confusing. Ahhahha. He is a funny character. He can’t really speak English well. . . . . . . 
He is saying MCM arrangement and Calibration he charge
But would always argue in English. . Mcm arrangement is like rm6. Calibration is rm380 I think
Pipeline Flushing and Mobilisation he concede. Per dispenser?. Or Per hose. Still signif if per hosr
Should be per dispenser
That would be ~1.2k per dispenser if per hose
Crazy. . He is like a mosquito seriously
I think it is per hose. Sort this?? tmrw
U hv to keep calling him. . And he keeps taking you around the taman
I am sure that dude will be excitable
Give him something to do with GC. . Their favourite topic. Either atg. Or dispenser. . . . . . . . 
GC is also a funny character.
U dunno only. . I used to hv arguments with him. Kenny has to come and talk to
Didnt know he managed do many international direct reports. *so many
Amy can’t stand him
Glamour betul
He is a bit of a mcp. . So would often make degrading remarks at her
??
Is it degrading or degradatory. . Which is it
<Media omitted>
Degradatory then. . Did u give that guy homework for solar. He said he will dial in but that he send his info by email to u alr. I will be 5mins late. . . . . . . . 
Come to level 34. Only you and me in person that guyk and that poor guy will be virtual
Where. . Coming
34 09
that gal that company.vcf (file attached). . <Media omitted>. Can I ask u. Is this actually required for all colo partners. Like GoCar. Who may not do any construction work at site. . . . . . 
Dunno. Need to check. But if no construction then no lor.
Just saw Adlan. . It will be a f2f right. Coz he said he will go to 27. We are in the room opposite the it room in level 28. If u wanna come. Eh sorry Morning I had the mlar audit so I missed the island elongation. So long story short I am guessing we screwed up on IP and that company screwed up projects controls. . . . . 
Close enough
Lol. . Lesson learned. Do IP properly. that company - buck up. . . . . . . . 
I think i am making their PMs sweat.
Yes. . See just text me
But if they did the things they are supposed to do i wouldnt need to
I ask him if the meeting is on tomorrow. . He said scared I scold Hamid. And scared u scold him. Lol. . . . . . . . 
Yes. Partnership based on fear.. I gave him a talking to last wk. On something else.
I heard
From him or others?
Him la. . Even that dude is sweating. Lol
They will be glad when i suddenly declare i am leaving
Did u also scold that guy today
Did that guy say that?
No. . I assume. Since u two in the room
No lar. He is my senpai. How can
What is senpai
Jap culture means "senior". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senpai_and_k%C5%8Dhai. Really ar?
Yeah la. . He prob had never had to write so many emails in his life. And I know u looked and are stressed. So here is what I do. 1. Eat lunch with your retail colleagues  - sometimes u get shit done then. 2. Watch one movie a day / try to. . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
3. Things that are not moving/ I go to my boss and let her manage- she is paid so let her do some work too. . 4. Hv breakfast. 5. Rant to your friend. Almost forgot no5. . . . . . . . 
No 9. 4+5
Apa ni. . I tot of this coz someone commented u got panda eyes since u join retail
Someone here or someone i know from way back ?
Someone in retail. . The only someone that u and I know in upstream is your friend. Oh but u also know zamir
True but he left oledi no?
Yes left - went to pemandu. . Just got married to surin. I can hear people behind me in disbelief surin married him!!!. When he sent invitation cards to us hahja. . . . . . . . 
I know Sureen v well
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
Her sis used to be ex retail. I went for reception
Zamir is my buddy. . U did !!!
Betul ke.. Where were you
Zamir and your friend. . I was in Cameron’s. Shell bungalow
Ah
Kapur room ?. . Zhi. Tomorrow after capex meeting. U are lunching with me and that dood. . . . . . . . 
Can
Booked your calendar alr
What do you think about getting that company project manager to also attend. I may not be able to stay for the entire meeting maybe just the first 30 minutes clash with another co locator the meeting
For which one. . For Turnkey yes. I was thinking about that. Would it not be See ?. I heard he is gonna take over Turnkey. Or that guy still. I dunno why u need to go to the colo meeting actually. Even that weird  lady doesn’t attend. . . . 
There has been a lot of issues lately not just for this year's program but also quality issues on 2017 and that dood asking them to survey this and that to prepare for 2019. There's a very interesting development related to sunway mentari colo building plan approval from the council suggest that Green Building Certification needed
What ?. . How did that happen
Could you check with that dude who is the p.m. for the two sites they we are meeting with the detik kenchana tomorrow see whether they are free to attend. I forward a letter to you later
Ok. . Need to ask that dood. If it’s ok. Let me call that dood now. . . . . . . . 
Thanks
If yes I will fwd the invite
I think it is Gary but check with that dude we've been shuffling this a few times already and I cannot remember to be honest
that dood said no need. . As there is a speedwork meeting next thurs. He would prefer to do the briefing then and not muffle it tomorrow. Since it’s specific to DK. . . . . . . . 
Muffle?. You mean muddle
Muddle. . Lol
Or maglink
Lol. . Mugging
I was in a 15 minute conversation where they kept on talking about muggling muggling. Good that mystery solved
Just saw your email on sunway mentari
Interesting hor
Don’t think Pram can handle it. . And if it’s additional cost to Texas it will be difficult. I would use that weird  lady to lobby that. Is it too late to recalibrate the sites and insert sunway mentari in the that company study. . . . . . . . 
I think it's a little bit unfair on that company best way to keep swapping
So odd that it’s only for the DT
TRUE
Our govt is also stupid. . It’s not like we can only hv Texas chicken DT that company -ed
Yes that was my point
Another day another idiot
I guess it is timely that we initiated this study
But it’s indicative more of these will come
So far only this one council
Eh can I go to ISni petro with u guys next week
Caaan.
If I can go I will go
See needs to set time
For my education
O invite
Ok
No invite

As in he didnt send. This fella all over. The retailer training is nonsense. I will ask Ruzana to release him. Maybe send Gary. <Media omitted>. New RVI spec. Rainbow Visual Identity
Joke right. . Coz it’s not allowed for malaysia
Need to arrange global frame agreement
They had a lgbt pecten last year and big hoo has
Dont worry. New Malaysia more tolerant. Betul ke?
U are kidding right
Really
Yes
Yes. Of course
that IT guy had a lot of work after that. . I mean the rvie ????????. U r kidding ????
Hehe. U will find out later. GC and Amy will contact you.. Dye to get rainbow color very specialised
Omfg. . The shell station is looking like a circus
So must order from Czech republic
Giant that coffee co cup. . Giant lubes (soon). Rainbow rvie. We just need the site heroes to dress up like clowns. . . . . . . . 
Yes. The lgbt will tank us for lubes. Come to 34?. that guy lar here
Ok. . Coming
Coming ?. Tank nonsense?
Ahhaha. . No
Can u help craft reply note to Pram? Lets send to him n khim bok before end day for what its worth. Or u think just discuss tmrw afternoon straight?
Sure. . Is my note good enough ?. I will remove all the sarcastic notes
This Pram.. Miss call me 3 times.
Sigh
Finally spoke to him. He was a bit defensive.
What he said
See his panjang cerita reply. Fwded
He didn’t like my feedback ?
I also fed up. Say let's discuss tmrw
Lol
Teruk lar.. After all this that dood came kacau me abt some colo nonsense
lol. . He is young - need Coaching. You know who he reports too. To. . . . . . . . 
In addition to having to cut 3m USD, deal w Fire Incident investigation (that i missed this morning), dealing w Finance STB board reporting etc. I told him to settle w that dude. And tell Khaled to do his damn job
Lol. . that dood is frustrated
With?
that company. . They see u as someone reasonable and would guide. Coz they hv poor leaders. It’s a shell dilemma. Poor leaders leading the company superficially. Delivering through poor misguided contractors like that dood. Teach them to make your life easier haha. . . . . . 
Then after that TM in Borneo call me ask me how come 2wks never reply to mail asking for site layout. that other guy happily said- not on record Z can assist w that company?
Just eff the white noise
So much noise. How to focus
U hv to. . But not too much like that guy who ignores most things
80% is noise or effort to push noise
But that’s how he survives
I can see why. This job can wear a person out. Nobody cares what else u got
Yeah ... he wasn’t always like
U engineer. Why-. original design. imes always rely on that company. I hate it man. I push all to that company so think that dude and team feeling the heat but they also struggling. Capacity problem
Feel you need an assistant
that dude lor
Small little deli2go has got an army
Yes. Crazy
Cannot brain it
But argument is i have 40pax. By proxy. So why so hard?. Why ar i also dunno
But everyone needs a piece of epcm Manager. . U hv to deliver their target
My upstream colleague cannit understand what so hard abt my job now
Deli2go doesn’t deliver your target. . I know. your friend doesn’t understand why I hv so much work lol
Jokingly ask me if i selling more coffee lately and how come that coffee co at l27 tak sedap. Depressing
Ck doesn’t recognise how much it drains you an that guy lar
You need to get into upstream. You will run rings around the others. Yeah i worry abt him too
that guy lar is basically telling the auditors to just bring it on - what else. . He din bother to prep - just high level with me. What u mean
He also seem feddap. I had long car ride chat. He also seems frustrated
Of coz la
Wonder what us in it for him
What u mean by run rings
Run circles ard them while they are still standing still figuring out which way is up. But you might die from frustration
That’s even more frustrating
Ask your friend abt MPM PTCAM. And cost recovery
She hates her job
Acv mgmt. Ocs. All the slooooow processes
I told her u two shouldn’t lunch together
She ssid she started looking outside. Why?
Yeah. . U two will depress each other out lol
Her boss who i know quite well also just resign
Yeah
Politiks or something
Another useless cp who is her’s boss. . I told u it’s a shell dilemma. Wrong ppl climb the ladder. Except for that lady haha. I work wirh almost all the marketing ppl and all are incompetent except for that IT guy and yee kang. The younger ones are misguided or not guided. . . . . . 
Yes. Chang Hwee looks lost mostly. that lady tries to manage via relationship or pressuring ppl
They feel they are entitled to that company. . I don’t like her
Yeevon looks like just trying to get by
Lavonne too
I know. I also get bad vibes.
She backstabbed that guy before so I don’t hv a good impression of that lady. . Most hv lost the plot and just want to deliver through others and survive
Hmm...anyway. i am perceived as that guye guy pushover so i normally dont kena. Not worth these alpha dominant type's time
They like u coz that guy brushes them off. . But time to show your belang haha. U may suddenly hv less shit. But it’s not worth it. You should love your job. Should be some job that motivates u to come to work everyday. . . . . . 
Nah. Before i go i approve whatever leave some crazy time bomb/landmine for successor
U won’t la
I am too "straight narrow". Man of principles. ?
Not really. . Would say u are straight narrow u just talk facts and data. Which they lack
My primary hat is blue. Secondary is white and black. <Media omitted>. da boss is black as primary. And green as secondary i think which is weird. Most retail is red. With yellow and green. VPR U95 U97
You are white hat obviously
Blue. More than white
Oh true. . White and blue
I'm white only in service of blue. You seem blue black
How do u know ck’s colour. . Omg really
Observed in mtgs?
I tot I am positive
that poor guy sern and i are closely aligned hat wise. As far as i can tell.
Really ?
No?
Ask him to finish the econs for solar then ??
Youre right. That one shld hv gone to him
He is busy. . I understand
WEAllARE
I m still ok. . Lol. Don’t tell that madam hahahha
Only becoz U R A WORK MACHINE. What drives you?
Oh
There are defnitely easier jobs in Shell
I think it sounds cliche. . But it’s positivity and that lady
Yes she is that guye
I feel indebted to her
Wife was good fren w her
So I can’t screw up. . Lol. Yeah she told me. Omg. I just read Pram’s email. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. ]*#*+#+}}=*#*#*#. <Media omitted>. What’s the point of the blue bar??????. . . 
Show it is 100 lor as max. If not how would we know
It’s superfluous kan!!
Maybe we think it was 50
Lol
<Media omitted>. LCSC Q3 mtg- I am so thrilled to be here.
Lol. . Omg. U just made my Dady. Day. I see kantha. . . . . . . 
Yes. Gang's all here. that guy , that guy lar too. that company team etc
Too funny. . Looked happy at least. Try to look excited. Must say u look lighted up yesterday doing the training. . . . . . . . 
I only just got back. Eating now at l5. Ok if u set up laptop for the 230pm call?
I will try I am outside. . Willbe back on time
Pram + Rey are here on l27.. I am coming up soon
Ok getting my laptop. . Taking them to see the padas room
Huh. ?. Padas?. For nxt wk workshop ke?
Last thing that we did capture was on the tax incentive is only against the revenue in the form of rental generated from the retailer. Khim Bok will give the feedback from that company and send it to us. So this is the part where Farah needs to be involved.. . Hadri asked if Farah is invited to the workshop I ssaid yes , but she hasn’t accepted it
Sigh
Yes - asked if they need to stick anything , they say they will bring handouts and flash presentation. Split with you and Khim Bok what to present. Told him to come 30mins earlier. . I told him I will chase her. No need to worry about that
Sigh
Sent to Farah alr. . The entire tax thing. And reminder to go for the workshop. I booked kapur room. Level 28. . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>. Insert waah waah waah trombone sound effect. <Media omitted>
Lol. . How u found this sound effect
<Media omitted>
My colleague Jess heard the sound and asked to fwd to her. . da boss announcement is also one of those trombone momen t
Yes. Not sure what it means for me. I hv 1 on 1 this Thu
Do a jeng jeng jeng sound at him
<Media omitted>. <Media omitted>
Lol!!!
This Pram cannot brain what i wanted so i went and built up econs model myself incl sensitivities.. Will be providing some frank feedback to Vinesh when we see him Fri.
I scheduled the crmm for u guys. . For ?to ? talk
3rd Sep correct?
Yeah
After i kena pukau by his sly cow power. Suddenly everything all green
Only da boss does the pukau thing at u
Dunno what that dude feeds back to him
Anyway I m the dog there that will bite the cow. . That we are unreasonably demanding I suppose
I must strive to be more "brotherly"
It’s not in your dna . Don’t bother. . Hahahah
They are damn scared i ruin their chance for nxt year tender
It’s alr ruined
Dunno whether Artelia any better. I hear they also a bit duurrrrrr
We should work on ensuring docs are tip top do handover would be seamless hahahha. . Really?. I hope it’s not the case of shell blur so supplier also blur. That could hv been the case. Even for Malaysia. . . . . . . 
Sly cow not comimg tmrw
Eh read my comment. . Not surprised coz he can’t follow actually what has been done. He is typical consultant. Just repeat what u say. And pass it off with some “enhanced bullshit “ to make it flowery. . . . . . . 
Fertilizer
Just spoke to your friend. . It will be that guye if u could spend more lunches with her. Think u understand her level of frustration better than me and she really felt understood better after the lunch with u. I don’t hv that understanding coz I hv a great leader like that lady. Also coz u are going through the change similar to her. Eh pls buy water. Ahhaha. . . . . 
Today quite smooth. Surprised.. Thank god i did econ model if not we would be talkimg in circles.
Hahahahhaha it was too bad no that guy lar and Shivani. . Wanted finance perspective. Maybe should send her the pack and the econs model. Disappointed with Farah cuz all she said was the gita against the revenue which we alr discussed, and inconclusive info on mida, and that we should not minute what u mentioned about being blunt in our objective is the ita. Triple ??. . . . . . . 
Yes. ??x 3. But to be fair her focus now on SST nonsense
U know there is a tax team. . Aldred and gang. I also got sst nonsense
Incidentally u know that gal resigned right?
I know. . For some time. It’s not the first time
Worried abt that company and that other company readiness for SST
So ??????. . that other company is ok
I think blind spot
that company is not
Huh?
Next week we hv a meeting with finance. . 2nd time she resign. 2016 resign
Huh? She left & came back??
Came back 2017. . Yes
Left where to?
She is a weird one la. . IJM I think. Life is harder there
Feels like she can be smarter but pretend to be dumb
So she came back. . Erm. She is a QS. She is not too bad. . . . . . . . 
I think she is smarter than that guy
Just not procurement background. . They gave her wrong scope. She was from Jacobs. My fren was from Jacobs. My fren was PMO category manager. Worked with GC. Few people told me she resigned alr. Last day 16sept. Are they looking for replacement ?. that dude was very sly about this - he asked me before whether I know anyone in cp interested. But said it’s for another program. 
Junior cow. your friend ahahahahahahaha
She will kill both of us. . Hmmm but she is looking for CHANGE. Lol
From buying subsea eqpt to urinal fitting and tiling. Yes. Change
Big change. . She can do the solar power tender. Lol
I am so glad i gorenged the best xlsx today so can answer questions on spot
Lol. . Always bawse throw curve ball. In my heart I was thinking if it was that guy he would die standing
Yes but i think we managed ok
But then he would hv played it for that company to do everything. . Feel we need Khim Bok
True. I spoke to him quietly just now
He answered a lot of queries which pram couldnt. . Pram just looked flustered and confused
I feel like direct engagement best.. Yes confused. Blur like ??
Don’t think he followed the entire thing
I wonder what his normal day job is. Project director Wei
that dude just texted me the replacement coming on the 17th. . Lol. I feel underpaid. Lol. . . . . . . . 
If like that I also can be project director
Executive director. . Effing Vinesh not even here
To be fairthat weirdo of that company is also a managing director
Lol. . Wtf now I feel even more underpaid
I wonder where I could be if I leave and go to a slightly smaller organisation
Like Vinesh lor. . Country director
That's the problem with working for a large company like shell
your friend was feeling better today. . Then that lady made her cry hahahha
Oh no why
Lol. . I told your friend to stop the waterworks. It’s a phase I think I hope ot will pass
Seriously what happened?. Kena lectured?
Nope. . She was confiding to that lady. that lady is like our counsellor. Even if we don’t report to her. She is just awesome like that. Very rare amongst all the lousy leaders in shell. . . . . . 
You still working?. Offline but answering mails
Lol. . At RA just now. Forced to go. How come u are not in RA. . . . . . . . 
I heck care already.
that guy is on email diarrhoea. . Hahahah I wish I can . that madam made us go
yes lets chillax by putting me in front of stakeholders who will likely want to throttle me until i provide money / approvals / support / solutions to stupid legacy issues. Yes perfect way to start long weekend
Lollll
Anyway catch u monday if like that
The css thing was the BID case remember ?
Yes i know. I wanted to talk abt the solar and that company nonsense
When that guy did the ip remandate for the 5 sites
Call or talk f2f on Mon?
Was it included ??. . I am driving ahhahah. Text better
Dunno. Prob not
I need to go dig it
How the hell is texting while driving better. Anyway focus on road
I can text and drive
Talk mon
Okla
<Media omitted>
But likely it is not in the IP. . that company - when they gonna close it ar. I think once they provide the last study report , need Vinesh there to close it out on the next steps on IEN and the solar tender. New replacement for that gal only coming 17th. . . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
Lol. . Always getting his facts wrong. What else is new. When are we gonna do the close out. I won’t be around 6th onwards...... Let me know ya. . . . . . 
I shift to 5th Thu ?
Did u?. . I am ok 5th. I dunno about the others though
Ok. See howm
Yeah more important for hadri and da boss to attend
I dunno what is up w that guy. His "helpful" advice lately more distraction thsn help
Lol. . Actually it turned out his advise for solar was good. I met up with a fren last night who was doing solar. His recommendation was the same. Longhi brand solar panel. And ABB inverter. But use an e2e installer etc. But he said there wasn’t a need for German inverter. My fren didn’t further his business into solar as he felt it was not lucrative enough for small company like his. . . 
Can u pls reply that dude. He asked if we did IDD already on the Solar vendors in the xlsx u shared
Eh. . What u doing for lunch today. I might lunch wirh that dood so pls join us. They are here. Going down to pick them up. . . . . . . 
K. Omg. This kotak bingo so drama.
Fuck this box. . that weird  lady ask me to try and kill it. Farking andy keep threatening me
Kennot. It's been heboh'ed
Stupid chinaman
Shell must be no1
Stupid box. . I don’t make savings also
Dont understand why if that other fellow really keen on this just ask big bawse to deviate and overrule Kannan.
Cannot lei. . big bawse can’t overrule Kannan. It will be escalated to legal and abc sme. Stupid waste of time. Over a stupid box. . . . . . . 
Yeah lar but then now impossible situation. Biz want something and somehow we want things to magically work out.
It’s like this year in year out. . We hv done the impossible. Like that coffee co
I seriously think it will flop big
Worried people would be trapped inside. . Lol

Hv u tried happy pills
Xanax. Doesnt work
Lol. . Smoking ?. This one I can help
Nah.
Sounds like onset of midlife crisis
Then must buy fast car. Gamble and rack up huge debts. While unemployed. Preferably all same time.
All the 7 sins. . Start getting obese too. Hv a smoke with us. We start with that. . . . . . . . 
Buy overpriced car (envy), while sexing a floozy fling (lust), eating a bacon sandwich (gluttony), having funded this with embezzled money (greed), being generally angry (rage) and justifying to myself it is ok (pride) while not actually doing anything to improve my outlook (sloth)
It’s not rage. . Wrath
????. Techthat guyally anger.. Close enough. Why you disagree. I fight you
Isn’t the proper term wrath. . Based on the movie 7even. Ahhaha. Eh wait. I offer u cig as opposed to weed. Take the offer. . . . . .

Hahhaha
Hope she can get along w that fella. Maybe bvoz "N" name gang
that fella is a balance of u and that guy. . he's a bit of a brute but also very structured. so it's a hybrid lor. I should arrange handover like NOW. . . . . . . . 
HR supposed to talk to me but bz in Labuan. I too gentleman?
Hahahahahshsha. . Too that guye. U do other people’s job. Either coz u can’t stand mediocre or non performance. Or just too that guye. . . . . . .

Or not go into solution mode but coach people into coming to that solution
WHERE GOT. Yes. 10,000 work hours later.
But coaching needs work
Oh. So that's how step 1 (of 25) works
U try la. . Like that guy. Sit back and let things go haywire. Lol. Rescue only when 80% on fire. . . . . . . 
Here is a wooden block let's coach it into being an EPC Manager.
Nooo it’s coaching ppl like that weird  lady. . No feeding until u start thinking. Whip into shape like mayonnaise
Like meringue. Must stir so hard it can denaturing the protein ovalbumin to make the egg white stiffen.

Yes of course. _Bedtime story papa_? No not tonight kids. Gather round and let me instead tell you abt how we changed surau floor space to minimise costs
Hahahhaha
This job is toxic. At least toxic to me
Like a toilet
Yes. Good analogy. Full of shit snd poop. Ppl need it but dont think too much abt it unless it is clogged or broken then everything becomes urgent. Wait i meant to say shit and piss. Just realised shit=poop=??
Lol. . Exactly it’s full of shit. So it could still be poop
You seem to be thriving.
I unclog and detox well. . Must “download”. I like to. That pump to unclog what do u call that thing. Plunger ?. . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>. Ini ke bos?
Yes that’s me. . Ahhahaha. That should be your profile pic. We are plungers / Pump / whatever it’s called. Not that invisible man. U hv in uour profile pic. . . . . . 
I am so frequently mistaken as Cher i should use his image as profile pic.
No
Then he can sub for me.
He has a diff voice. . Oh 2 Zhis
He doesnt hv to say much.. Just sigh abd shake head a lot
Just come in late. . Sounds like a plan. Although he hides in level 31. Think he wants to avoid people thinking he is u. Yes half of nfr hides out in 31st floor. . . . . . . 
I dunno if serious or joking. <Media omitted>
It’s a joke ahhaha
I wonder...
They hide out in level 31. . Coz they fedup. Hew does 3 days in 31 and 2 days in 34
Wah.

I hear that other fellow very intense
He is demanding but
But also super surfacey
He is alright I feel. . Compliance is major for him and also demanding. He cut a lot of fluffy expenses. Internal expenses for parties / lunches / bla bla. Respect him for that. And always put emphasis on cp governance and Abc. The team doesn’t like it but he is a change agent. . . . . 
Taking cue from big bawse and Cecilia
Also ai kee. . It could be the new beginning. “. Maybe u can do a “return of the Jedi”. . . . . . . .

Ahhaha
Kena cut and mati in Episode 1.. And doomed everyone by making bad decisions
But he lives......spiritually that qui gon Jin. . Stay U Must
(Ie deciding to train anakin)
Yes he was a fool. . The most foolish Jedi. Trained the Jedi who was clearly going to the dark side. I think I am short enough to be God’s. Yoda. Powerful u hv become, I sense a dark side in u ... something like that. Ok qui gon Jin , sleep u must. . . . . 
Nitinder TNB.vcf (file attached)
I called him. . He said it’s wirh him. Sending it today. Nitinder I mean. I can’t make it to the MPIA engagement tomorrow. I gotta go to Gshock meeting. And need to sit with legal and joe for EV Charging at 10.30. . . . . 
Ok super.. Just me and that company then.
Just leave it for them to go
No no must ponteng LRLT. Now got excus

Tmrw lts1 how ar?
Sigh. . Go through drawing - confirm and let’s just ask for a bit more reduction. Assuming that company did the right costing. Then we can ask for about 90K more. You saw my analysis. That I had to redo again. <Media omitted>. Reminder to do my performance feedback boss. . . .

What rbsam element that company missed out for lts1?
Just a caveat that they may hv missed it. . I am not confident with their costing
Ah.. Can u pull up the last lts1 costing that company vs vertex for 130pm. Lets see if the fuel sys cost diff was equally big last round.
Sure. . Actually I got it. that company cost for ufs didn’t change. It was Vertex who increased the price. From rev 6. 1865570 to 1900570. . . . . . 
Hmmmmmmm.....
Ok. . Enough grounds to just ask for a revision
Lets look closer later.. Thus site Nera 7L

U know she cannot drive to work anymore. . Something is wrong with retail. Had a chat with that other guy today. Quite a long on w. One. He wanted to know if I was moving on. He did not hv a good cp support in Indonesia. So I think he was trying to weigh his options. . . . 
Why?
She will vomit few times. . Due to the anxiety thing
Triggered by that dood ?
No. . that lady. One of the factors
Who is that lady?
Ahhaa. . dat lady. Normally sits near u. Near that dood side. . . . . . . . 
The big one?. No tudung?

that guy attack le. Haven’t u got one already ?
Not yet.
U hv gone mad i guess. . Not pathat guy
Mad insane or mad angry?
Mad insane. . Like the kate spade remark

Obviously
He might do a jeng jeng jeng and eff everyone and take another role lol
Well i am also bye bye all. If they keep me i will just run this to the ground. And then leave anyway. So da boss must pukau him to stay. So much to look fwd to
I tried to psycho him not to
Vomit attack, fainting, heart attack. So u can one day take big bawse's job
Lol
Bike accident then can wear terminator brace
Why is See being emo ar. . Is there a miscommuthat guyation. Omg your profile pic
Epic hor
??. . I prefer this one. It can be “gosh”, “omg”, “too stupid for words” , “speechless”. “Better shuddup”. . . . . . . . 
This job need someone w flex and big picture focus who can think on their feet and quick to capture opportunities
that other guy was very humble
I took offense at that dood's oh thanks Z for micromanaging. And restraining flex
He said Indonesia is only 20M capex, nothing like Malaysia. . He did had a comeback. Saying that he appreciated how u micromanage some of the details. He said that guy has a lot of flex. That also meant he was careless with details. Like leaving out the Turnkey  engineering standards to give to Opus !!!. that dude’s statement paling best. . . . . 
Yes. that dude will outlast everyone
Nooo. . What he said. About people who don’t do the work get rewarded. Lol. . . . . . . . 
I know
Hv to say. . Network people hv the most awkward-est speeches
I will continue this tradition. Maybe that dude shaken that I also surrendered
Which tradition? Not being rewarded or the awkwardness. . Lol
Awkwardness
Lol
I am ball of negative sunshine. Sapping away positive energy
If people don’t see u in your tulanness u can appear to be sunshine-y
Nanti i influence others to leave
Be a resilience consultant
Only if ppl blind
Sadly a lot of blind people in retail. . Hahahhahahha
Blinded by my sunny disposition??
Chaming
Peesanuleet. My thai style too bright
Your alter ego. . Your dr jeckyll. <Media omitted>. For your profile pic. . . . . . . .

Hahahahhaha. . Before I forget
Yes because clearly i will remember. And will fwd to my successor
Lol. . I can’t stand it coz my regional CP guy can never give me a straight answer
U know i am representing network next week at T&R wshop in Port Dickson

Yar. Time for me to make crazy promises. And commit to everything
Ck is crazy to set u up for it
Actually i think he left it to that guy. that guy delegate
I dunno what that guy does most of the time
It was between me or Mr. Sim TK
That one also a survivor
I also dunno. I bet that guy himself also unsure
No way. . Hahahah. He is damn sure who he delegated it to. Lol. . . . . . . . 
Now too long he scared to ask his own team acruarry arr what is my job leh
He gets hammered by that dood via email
Clearly that dood got 0 respect for him
that dood has very little respect for anyone lol
But ok wor. He fought for that dood's IPF. TRUE
Lol
He is a bit on arrogant side
A bit is an understatement
Likes to boss poor ..
And the rest of them. . I hv lots of eyes and ears in that prop firm. Hehhe
I dunno. Maybe that company think i like to boss them ard too.
Hence the emo-ness of See. . Contrary to what u may believe - that dude only speak of good things of u. He was more emo during that guy’s time. Prob he is also getting tired. that guy lar also said that today. That Zhi brought in a lot of structure to that company. . . . . . 
But has this structure translated to business results.
??. . U got me there
Structure no need. that guy got on just fine w out all this nonsense structure. Like that guy said. Wah this year easy wat. All budget cut.
I think the business results is knowing what we are spending, how we spend and spend as soon as possible. . Lol. And trying to make sense of what the spend is. I think before this it is a bit of a blur. Eh I cannot tahan the typo. On pick wai’s invite you forwarded to me. Did she mean demolition and not demolation. . . . . 
<Media omitted>. At least not immolation
So it’s a typo right
Nah. Engineering term
What???
CK also power engrish.
How can it be an engineering term. . U joking. I need Zhi, go away Chaming. It is demolition right ?. . . . . . . . 
Zhi has *resumed* the role of EPCM Manager for several months in 2018.  During the past few months, Zhi has established himself as a *competence* EPCM Manager and has been *instrumenting* several initiatives that *path* the way for future success.  Among others, Zhi has started *rolling the ball* for Malaysia to achieve that company status for our sites.  Zhi has demonstrated *good leadership in leading* his EPCM team (Partner) to achieve most of the targets.  Nevertheless, CO NTIs opening will be behind plan. 
Isn’t it competent
<Media omitted>
Instrumental right
That's me rolling the ball
Started rolling the ball. . Omg. I like the achieve MOST of the target
But started only

Eh.. Special visitor
Yes he just left. . Zaha still here. Come down and see what we did to her desk. eh coming ?. Ground floor. According to that guy, Zhi told him not to do anything first until he sets the direction. This apparently happened post that meeting with the council guy. From that dude. Thr was a meeting with this guy who represents some green council la cant remember but zhi attended with that guy & that guy . Excuse from that guy. . . 
Yes of course
Who is this green council guy

Too tall. . And not bulat enough
Z doesnt exist. Actually Cher pretending to be 10 yrs older and experienced engineer.. Z used to work for Chairman who advised him to resign if he was so unhappy
This is not good. . Z demanded chairman to give him a job. Or he will tell all his secrets. Blackmail. . . . . . . .

During motogp promo downstairs

Female staff say how can got race girls. Demeaning and not right. He asked her to look the other way lor
Hahahhahahhaha
And he brushed her off
Did u hear about the theft in Bingobox. . Someone tried to “beat the Bingobox”
Wah. What?
Fella stole rm70. . Manage to get out. Was sent sms
I thought all cashless
Rm70 worth of stuff
70RM of merchandise?
He got bolder. . Went back to the box folllowing day. And the box said “welcome back! U still owe us rm70”
site staff didnt notice?
He got freaked out and paid
Got photo ar. Sounds amusing
I dunno how he got out. . Yes. Facial recognition Ma. <Media omitted>. The bigger the kW size and de lower de solar price de better is de nos. For 20 years tenure and 50% capex SEP tthat guy is 0.25. Zhi... the Y azis is the Tenure...and X Axis is the Capex ..... . . . . 
master agreement as individual tripartite agreements are study dependent.....onnsizing , shading and location among others....
Uncle Nirinder sent me this
Good he thinks u r me.. No email ke? Just whatsapp?
That’s why. . I ask him to email. Prob not allowed to until nda is signed hence maybe why he whatsapp me
Worse case screen shot whole thing shate w that poor guy. *share

KwP
Problem is he never share what is typical site. Maybe he dunno too
Hence the site visit he proposed Ma
I didnt read tnb legal comment on our nda. Susah ke?
Prob only Nirinder has a really clear mind
Anyway i am gone. This will not move quick enuf

Lol. . I think that lady was shocked. Lol

Your pj housewife joke
U know this job has utterly broken me.. It was gradual process but one day i woke up and realised nope cannot anymore.. Today i had call abt toilets again.. Thank god i am leaving.
Ohmy. . Again. I mean what can it possibly be about
<Media omitted>. Yeahhhh toilets. Yes we are all bros
I was gonna say that. . Bro. Tell u a joke. We had a Steerco meeting for IT support and MHS GSS decision on rfp. At the start of the meeting. Faisal asked if everyone is here- then he said what about Moy that madam( he doesn’t know who she is ). I said “no need , she can’t make it so pls proceed”. big bawse laughed and said “ ohmy I like how he asked if your boss is needed here and u said no neeeeeeedddddd”. He said “ au and Ruzanna I am leaving it to u two, I am gonna leave “. So many decisions fall on big bawse that rightfully shouldn’t. Same as u, “how ar Zhi “ for u but it’s also “how ar big bawse “for big bawse. 
Still waiting for punch line...
That’s the punchline la
Oh. You lied. Not joke
I didn’t lie
At best amusing anecdote
I really didn’t need that madam. . She doesn’t understand IT
You lied abt the joke
Oh. . Yes amusing at best
But yes. I sm prob more broken than chang hwee who u said is depressive. Thsnkfully i am high functioning
Oh he seems more normal. . Lately. Very super friendly
Yeah. Cant tell
A little overconfident even
But even more tragic when u find out the type of work i used to do and my lost potential.
Didn’t da boss find it tragic too
Ya lor
Chairman should hv offered u something
He was like what happen dood
Lol. . What happened bro
Bro apa mcm?
U mean he didn’t see it ?
See who?
You hid it too well
See what
See that u were depressed. . Don’t u two have 1:1s
Not really. The poor guy double hatting too
Lol. . He is still very sharp
He left me in capable coaching of my peers like that guy and that guy the truly inspirational leaders i needed
Lol
See if u work hard maybe u too can take their jobs
I can. . But it’s not about working hard in shell
Just take it coffee/bun/toilet/tank/nti at a time
Lol
1 bun then the next
That’s a good one - put it in your book of jokes

<Media omitted>
Sigh. . Just met adlan and Nadia in the lift. I know now that Nadia reads your email. And adlan still asking what is that cents u mentioned savings. Kak ram is a tricky one. U wanna pity her. Every year she has to ask for her contract renewal which is normal but often quite last minute. I used to help that guy with the contract staff. Coz iqn was my stuff and promicom was my supplier. U know even Nadia is leaving for audit. . 
??????. Internal to Shell?
So by jan I might be the only constant minus that guy who was never constant to begin with. . Yeap. SIA
<Media omitted>
But yes Kak ram. . Not the best but who wants to do the work she does
Omg could be description for EPCM or FMC job
Lol. . Job description: you are in for a surprise. Sad. I kinda like my job. . . . . . . . 
You DO?. Only because u memang masochist.. that dude arranging mtg for me w my favorite colo clowns khalid new that guy amirul. To talk abt 2017 Colo VO. Their argument is aiyo no budget- so how ?

Scared my hand pain. They quite thick slin. Skin
U want me to sit in kah. . that dude use to always exclude me. Then that guy and that weird  lady or Lucy would pull me in. They just wanna go to Zhi and ask how ar Zhi, u pandai we stupid. . . . . . . . 
Fri morning. I dont have money anymore. Sorry is my answer
I think it’s because u give them solution that’s why that dude likes u and bro u. . He doesn’t hv to use his head anymore coz he can use Zhi’s head. Process for VO is that they suppose to write a MOC and explain the VO and hv finance to signoff u know. Tell him no MOC no talk. Btw did that dude revise the MoC we talked about. Bugger is slacking. U need to sweepslap him. . . . . 
He must know. I am leaving
He tried to fish yesterday
Trying luck to slack and hope u dont replace me
Eh u also masochist. . U did everything nobody wants to look at. The circus. Lol. . . . . . . . 
Like what
Circus. . that company. <Media omitted>. Speaking of masochist, this is what I make my son do . Stare at the map. . . . . . . . 
Punishment?. I tell my kids stories at night
No I make him do it. . So I don’t hv to read him stories. He reads to me. But he has smartened up so he rather read the map. . . . . . . . 
Caught anything?
Of coz not/ I am a slippery eel. . I like to torture him
I hate this job so much.
Hahaha. . I bet that poor girl can feel the hate through the cubicle
I scared i poisoning her.. Toxic co worker. I am not an inspiring leader
Lucky I am so anti poison
Except that poor fellow seems to look up to me bizzarely.. One time so weird u remember after mtg he shake my hand
I think he idolises u la. . Of coz young chap like him after 2 yrs in a daze under that dude and that guy, u were the challenge he needed. And embraced. He is maybe only 24. that weird  lady also looks up to u wat. . . . . . . 
I wonder if i am role model for anyone else
that weird  lady. . And joari ahhahaha according to that dude. that guy lar I think. He likes u. . . . . . . . 
No not likes but role model.. that dood thinks i am too detailed and no flex. that guy sad i am going. He said oh no you were one of few ppl that think logically in whole biz
That was such an unforgiving remark. . Ahhahah
True no?
I dunno . that dood is like a wild card. . He is like road runner. The Road Runner
Speed is his forte
Always on the go, fast and furious but always on the same race. . I don’t think it’s speed. Feels he doesn’t commuthat guyate well. He is a bit of an acquired taste la. . . . . . . . 
Ok what. No need email panjsmg panjang just swing by and chat
He wants to be Harvey Specter. . He told me that
What?
Sometimes I think he is almost Macam not being himself
?
Guy in Suits. . The series
Is he Neb ie reverse that dood
I didn’t watch it. . So sometimes that dood’s say stuff that is kinda sounds like it’s from some movie. Hv u not noticed
What genre?. Action?
I finally know that he likes Suits. . Lawyer. Megan markle. Go and see one episode - u will know that dood tries to be Harvey Specter. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PETOFXMiupY. . . . . . . 
The pretend lawyer?. Or that other dude?
The one sitting down. . that dood can quote lines from Suits. Actually the most regular guy in retail is probably yee kang
You mentioned by name as having sapu'ed 3 gemilang awards.
Wow. . Where who?
that other fellow
Ahhaha. . At least I am mentioned for the right stuff. Not for being an asshole cp
IT kena skewered abt Diebold Contract Renewal. How come now DN dont hv bonus/malus incentive scheme?
Got lor. . It’s called credit scheme. Sigh. Natasha is there kah. . . . . . . . 
She makes it sound like current scheme not effective. Yes
It is not. . That’s why we retendering. Earlier credit scheme they (DN) don’t even feel any pain
Poor Natasha. When presenting she had super tsuey luck her microphone broke down when she talk abt uptime
She very resilient
Looks like. Wonder if we look at DN's SLA/Uptime vs how that other company's contract structured.. Seems like IT has a lot catching up. to do
I did that alr. . We have mirrored FMC with DN. But it’s not so simple of coz. Sla is very different for DN. And it won’t solve the root cause. Root cause is the namos solution itself. Of which Natasha and team is alr working on fr8 and fr10 (next). <Media omitted>. Tmn Connaught. POS laju complaining. . 
Fwded to that dude/Gary?
Not yet. . I recthat dude I shouldn’t. Odd coming from cp ahaha
Not so odd if u are the  EPCM Mgr in waiting.
They prob didn’t assess that it will block poslaju customers. . Lol
Today most likely can finish sky lift usage
We cannot let this lie manifest into a monster
??from that dude. Too late genie dah escape. I already telling everyone here

Asking me what is the standard parking for retail station how to determine ( because of the mcD meeting they had with retailers and joari- asking for 30 parking space). . She thought it’s in the hsse colo framework. I said it’s likely in the guideline somewhere like iro

Told her to ask that guy. . Yes. that guy and that poor guyy. Yes that other fellow ask her. She asked me yesterday. How would I know wor. . . . . . 
I am quite sure don't hv so far. I replied to her 1 spot fot each 500sqft.. *for
It’s prob in that iro thing
Local council req us thereabouts. Eg DBKL.
She told me this too
People are always complaining
Now I know it’s from you
that dude??. WTF
Man up la u tell him
What kind of question is that. Shell dont approve my FTE. How to man up
Ahhaha. . Ask him don’t be a ninny. If they are doing damansara Jaya next. Then just inform TM. If work was easy we won’t need that company la. Your pd session is bashing session izzit. . . . . . 
Dunno. I am reading emails/surfing net.. All this 2019 stuff someone else's targets. So here in person but my spirit elsewhere...

<Media omitted>
Inception. . I never got the ending. Tak faham the ending
It's meant to be ambiguous
Gave me a headache
Is he still in a dream or did he get out?
My guess was he was still in a dream
Good ending. Bold choice to leave it open ended
That’s u. . Closure is good. I hate these kinda movies. Anti climax. Like Lost In Translation. Big hype about what he said to her at the end. Shutter Island also. . . . . 
I really liked Lost In Translation.
Why
Bill Murray does  the best tulan face. <Media omitted>

Hahahhahah what a joke. . You should go logged your own ticket !. Ahhaha
Yes. Hilarious
Funny. . So when u signed the letter where did it go
I gave to da boss to sign and get big bawse to sign
After that ?
I dunno. I assume someone passed to HR
Joke really. . Carolyn must hv said to da boss to log the ticket
Ya lor
So when is the effective date
I asked Dec but email no date wor.
Ohno another round of circus lor. . that dood was asking me this morning what are the timelines for the NTI Turnkey to complete. I said didn’t Sulaimi share with u. He said he gave him some sketchy idea and I ask how is that dood suppose to work with the partners blindly without knowing the planned otp dates of the sites. We are so disconnected it’s so painful. I said Sulaimi needs to monitor the milestone payments. Sulaimi told him it’s under engineering pulak. Omg. Whether is engineering or RRE, can’t someone just tell that dood. . . . 
You are right. Network planners hv a list and it's also in T&R 2019. By right that weird  lady has this too.. Thankfully it's bye bye from Z
Does that weird  lady hv it. . Damn sien la. The myp u sent me was rev01. I just give that dood the projected timeline for completion for the 5 sites. . . . . . . . 
Ask him to get from that guy/that poor guy next week. that poor guy did a list for 5 Remandate sites  assuming +2mths for OTP post the contractual CCC milestone.
It’s not only these 5
Not latest anymore. I know planners should hv for all CoLos. The problem is the 7 sites in 2019 T&R no firm dates as workplan not finalised. Waiting for 31st Oct as both that company/that other company supposed to give start fin dates for ALL CAPEX 2019 work.
Sigh
Do u want to see a joke. that other company not behaving that guye w that company. Partial rewiring- that other company thought under them for 2019, discovered it's not. Now saying if the detailed scoping is based on actual site visit.
U mean now they challenge that company?. . This that dude is annoying me today. <Media omitted>. Fucking chasing me pulak ..... . . . . . . . 
Ask him. The sustainable purchasing policy he is supposed to get that guy  to assess the gaps for Shell supplied eqpt/construction materials
He hasn’t caught up with your email obviously
Also how come he only flag this now . What the f were they doing all this while dince Prem handed over. No email. I called him yesterday. He knows his team also supposed to review power eff of fridge air cond etc

Nadia alr msg me yesterday. . She will get it done by Monday. First she was trying to explain to me why we avoid saying “sharing of the that doodefit”. She said we are “taking a cut “ and not sharing. Wahhhhh I said I can not argue with a lawyer la. Then she said no la, she just thought best to clthat guyy that we don’t use wrong terminology. Essentially it means the same thing. But u know lawyers. After she saw the back and forth email with adlan she tot she better stop replying. And adlan ping me in the evening. Yesterday.

Funny hor. Fate or something

In the past he does. . He and that guy will be on sparring war
Isit becoz i so that guye. I softy

Everyone got army
So always get help from that dood. . Coz what she is doing used to be that dood’s job
Ie NFR and Fuel Mktg. Got empire wei
Yeevon is alone though. . No army for her
Foot soldier. Cannon fodder
Han choong also struggling
Chang Hwee is bumbling sargeant
I think entire retail needs to refocus la. . Too much initiatives
that lady is scary political lieutenant
What ?. . She is not scary la .. Bimbo
Dont worry. U know we hv this wat
She is that guye but useless
<Media omitted>. 2019 also got WIP. See all clear now kan

What tge fuck
During rcw
26
U haven’t join
Top 10 maybe
In sunway pyramid
Top 15 ok. 26. If u hv 26 then sonething not right
Then I snuck out and had drinks with that IT guy. . Coz it was so rubbish
Fuck this just means cannot prioritise
We both worked on our laptops and drank
26
Those are main themes. . <Media omitted>
And nobody said. Hmmm 26 a bit a lot no?
Then this lor. . Dunno le I left remember. Drown ourselves in maritinis. Working on the singing pump. Martinis. . . . . . . 
Even the whole project / site nomination process is broken
U saw the 27% CR growth. . They made retailer scan
I hv ideas of how to fix it using Excel/Ranking Algorithm/Ops Research Heuristic approach but that poor guy Sern looked crossed eyed and i said ok nevermind lets just go back to pasar malam style
Lol. . U saw Supply Chain?. All a lie. They make the vendor help retailers do stock count when it’s supposed to be their job. . . . . . . . 
Eh. No. Mike was like yeah man success all the way
He has a point. . He didn’t want to pamper the retailer. But what to do. Temporarily pay the vendor to do stock count for retailer. They are gonna discontinue the singing pump next year. Win award and then discontinue. . . . . . 
Next lvl karaoke pump. Must sing in tune to pam. that company new innovation
lol
Sore wa Karaoke No Pam pu des
Can’t believe I won that. . 3 weeks worth of work. All the painful stuff with ffs and I win nothing
Yr ipf must be 1.3. Or some amazing shit
Unsuccessful Calling. . 3 yrs in a row
that other fellow sing praises abt you. U fuckin kidding
Pfft he used to ignore me
I only got 1.3 once
Coz I challenge him about the stupid deli2go contract for operational excellence
Why u still JG4

How. Hiw is this possible
Not good enough. . Too long in jg4
CEP LC?
Nope
Or 1-2
Unlucky. . 43497. that lady said she will change it next year. I join as a jg5 sbo. 1 year later got jg4. And it’s been 7 years lor. . . . . . 
Epcm job here for the taking. Jg3 automatically yours
Lost a few jg3 roles to the angmohs
Think abt it
Yerrrr I don’t want your shitsweeping role
Walk in the park. No need buy uniform or milk
What did that other fellow say. . But that’s the fun part. I just never do tobacco and snacks
He said rely on CP bigtime. that lady sapu all the gemilang awards
No chance to do it. . Wow. that madam scratching her head how to pay me the rewards. I told her I claim business cost centre. . . . . . . . 
Joari also randomly praise me during PD workshop
She forgot I did that last year. . Wow. I dunno what u sis. Did. . . . . . . . 
But indirectly dissing that guy
Joari loves u. . He hates that guy. It’s no secret
Said Eng willing to listen now and take feedback on board
Yes that guy doesn’t layan him
Collaborative spirit
Joari need people to Angkat him. . He so uncle melayu shut
Aiyo old skool brader must hormat sikit
Shit
Yes. How u know
That’s why I cannot join business. . It’s so phoney. Phoney baloney
Actually i realise they set up right. If chinaman dealer/investor got Au
Yes. . That’s why that other fellow is there
If traditional melayu got big bawse. If more modern malay git Joari
And that’s why kenny won’t get bawse’s role. . And probably why nyon won’t get au’s role
Why
Skin colour lor
Nyon?!?!
U know nyon kah
Nyon Kam Yew?
Yeah
He will die standing lar. Never do retail b4
He won’t la. . He did la. He was a TM
Not in S&O
Soo siew wai knows him
Not as DM
As a TM
He terus CP after
Wah how u know. . Guy can talk
He was my wife boss mar
Oh!
He was my MBA senior also
Wat
Nottingham
I don’t necessarily think he is good but he can talk le
I also got deep roots in Shell. Yeah
I realize now. . Hahahha. Nyon has a secret weapon
He also work w me in Upstream trying dedperately to sell project Batik
Yes I was doing Batik!. . Omg. Fuck that project !
that poor guy Sern ?. I suspect that poor guy can further his career if he ride on Nyon's coat tails
The project caused me another year stuck in my role. . Why joe sern. Nyon recommended him ke
Yeah. It was a ploy to help sbo stay relevsnt. Nyon suka sama dia kan?
Yes it was put on hold. . And then I can start applying roles again. It caused me one year extension
He mentioned that poor guy when i ran into him last time and i said i am bsck in retail
Stupid project. . Ah. Nyon’s secret weapon is
Eh. Its the future of sbo
He remembers names and faces
???
I never reported to him. . I only know him in 2010 briefly
What stupid power is that. Oh my. He remembers faces
But I would bump into him 1
still remember me
Gives people false impression that he CARES. . Most of the grads thinks he CARES. A wonderful LEADER. Caring leader. Blablabla. Actually he’s just good wirh names and faces. Coz I caught a few people. Telling me that nyon so caring and nyon remembers them .... He is not bad but he is not a great leader. Greatness is like her and that lady. I got no future in cp I think. Coz challenge Yi boon some more
Aiyo. your friend bad influence. Jiao huai ni
Yes she was sitting next to me
Tsk tsk
He was talking about people who go on stia who don’t even report back to him even though he was their sponsor. . And only come to him when Iain made everyone come back. Pfffft
U know William Ng before Yi Boon before Peter Wong?
No , heard of him saje
That joker worse. Talk a lot but did little and left big mess when resigned
Peter wong I met him and he scolded my boss (she wasn’t there) and ask me to deliver the message to her. . Yes that about summarises him
He is ok. Old uncle style. Must earn his respect first then ok
Said to tell my boss , don’t come and shit here and leave
Wah
Uncle Ma
Sounds like him
First thing he asked me was who are u ,
Like KK Tan school of leadership
Why your boss send u two monkeys here

My twin. . My 2nd sis dated Nigel. My twin and I had to get lost. Go take a walk. I met him again when I join shell ..... like wtf why this fella look so familiar. . . . . . . 
He is big on nature hiking and outdoor shit

Au asked him how it happened and why. . He pause and said

I have to thanks.......CP. . Hahahhahaha. Thank*. He said out of the blue he thought of this idea. Ask me to source for the distributor. And he didn’t even know what promo to do. . . . . . 
Was it rushed and high impact? Nasib baik ada G Shock to help track time
Lol. . Helped yee kang to reach double digit growth. Even though his achievement  is still red
I sleep now bye bye . hope your father full recovery tmrw
Omg it’s 12. . I just force him to minum. Okla good night. Not sure if we have a generic ppt that outlines how a typical Shell site layout is developed. Intent is to provide that power company with a general understanding of how big/small our sites are (E.g Is there a rule of thumb where for every Pump Island/Canopy Column = ~ ?? m2 of roof area or something like that). Don’t we alr have this from the that company study. Think it came from joe sern isn’t it. . . . . . .

See. That is why i need to leave.. I am a crop farmer in land of cowboys.
Lol
It is true. And best part the biz will reward the that guys of the world.
More like u are still weeding
Got results mar. Yes. Part of farming is u have to till the soil and takes long time to get the payoff. This solar thing is bullshit. In between this i need to deal w NTI Tg Karang. DK sent a oh maybe got EOT and VO mail.
So fast for VO
To be fair we asl for extra pylon for colo so it's extra on top of BQ. *ask

How we do things one
Sigh
I will delay until aiyo i am lraving. *Leaving. Sorry byeee. Seriously. How are things done around here. It's like yeee-haw pew pew pew.. Things installed but contract not signed. Contract signed but nobody check if contract is legal. And when highlighted everyone is like oh then we check lor. Over to you current incumthat doodt. <Media omitted>
That’s why I asked who did the contract
I am sure this is just the surface and there are more surprises for other programs/jobs
Sien. . Nvrendeeeeeng. I like how everyone is dodging around it. Anna - reviewed but didn’t really review. that guy- erh ers check but didn’t really check. The only one sane and clear is Shivani. . . . . . 
I heard GoCar even worse. No contract signed ke?
What about it. . Signed alr. I paksa
Or money no collected?
Before the mou signing. . It took 1 year plus. But we got it done. Money will be collected. If there is anything under my radar I will get it done. If business cowboy then I cannot help. When that guy started on this. I only asked him how he pick the vendor and installer. Made him do the strategy paper. But contracting portion he said he will do it with legal. Barry replied. Feel the costing is dodgy and iffy
Leaving now. Barry Cheok- BCM Naluri.vcf (file attached)

Yeah lor but how else to "settle"
U r right it does feel like working for a totally sifferent company

2. This is something da boss wanted him to do
The job rubbed off on me.
To kill off the CF issue
So how ar how
I still wanna query Barry
But seriously. How lar
Lol
Aiya. Eh can check w that dude
I wouldn’t sign that at all
He know one the background
Just let him do it on a site per site basis
But ok already what
Hehhehe
No meh
No lor. . How lor. Zhi lor
We do so many yr oledi
Wtf right. . Unbelievable. When I first heard wind of this
big bawse also sign letter for some sites to Majlis
I did query that guy
Saying we appoint BCM to act for us
Yes. . Since azman time
Good lar. SIA can contact me when i am on sabbatical
To be fair to big bawse. . He would hv expected da boss and gang to do due diligence
Investigate Z. Always having lunch w Barry
big bawse checks with cp for a lot of things
Very shady
Lol. . Shady Barry and Zhi
Aiyo. Wish i ate more eagyu beef. Wagyu
Lol
Mmmm mmmm wagyu
Where did u lunch with him. . Meals ar
No. Jln Pudu
Sad. . Don’t tell me beef noodle. Instead of wagyu beef. What u actually drove out with him. . . . . . . . 
He give me so many hamper. Same ones he give to orang majlis. Inside got angpow manyak manyak
Ahhahahah hahahaha
Harr. You mean cannot ar?. Ok what
I told that guy why isn’t this under RE
that guy also got the golf set from him
U lying. . Right ?. Hahaha
Not ok ar?. Shell Guys Bagi Profit
Have u asked da boss about this
About whay
Ini Barry thing la
Some things da boss also dowan to know
Like “err boss , approve ar?. . No la he knows punya
Like how that other company ask for Capex but actually using it over diff sites to cover Opex
??
Apparently 1 on 1 w that guy lar ok.. W/ me he say oh not correct. Get down to bottom of it.
Lol. . Old man a lot of tricks
That is why the rewiring bullshit that that guy reply.. When i tarik from them they suddenly back pedal
That’s just silly way to work
Cause that company ask what scope for listed sites. The ol place if nothing else has no shortage of silliness.
I think so. . I like what u said about as if we are working for non shell company. Coz I did Global cp work before I came to retail. Nadia is the same u know- she said the same thing. And u know she is leaving. . . . . . . 
Eh tmrw can play game w Barry. Just b4 mtg i tell him i am being investigated by internal audit and i am therefore asked to resign by Dec.
Lol
Aiyo the hampers
that guy ask me just now “eh you do lor Zhi’s job”. . Yes your bluffs are working
Seeee. This was never zhi's job. Always that guy's. He so shiok still active on all the whatsapp groups
He is bored ka. . Bored la
Even the that coffee co cannot masuk he got komen. Undermines me.
Hajahahaha
Dunno if he realises
Wah. . What he said. How he undermined u
No not what he said but fact he still actively comments and gives his steer
Yeah

Maybe he tot he was helping u out
Yes obviously like how he helped so mych by talking to ERS to vlthat guyy that actually got no paper trail. Thanks man
Lol
Super helpful
Laughing here
Cannit blame him
I said to him thanks a lot for the reply to Zhi
Maybe this is what retail is about
Asking Zhi to go and see ST with ers
Aiyo ya lor. So insightful
I said to him he should close it out for u
No lar. that other guy. that other guy knows all now
Omg poor that other guy ahahhaa. . Wah so fast u handover. Speedy
Tmrw Tess want me to join Lucy and ORSN TM. For Eng bashing

This is what I gave him. . That bad. Shit. Something happened to the RA renovation. . . . . . . . 
?. Yes. Awful
that poor girl pathat guyking now. . I also dunno how she can survive so long. All the contract staff are abused man
Worse than my intense 6mths of the Org Restructuring Task Force.
Only just got it. . Got the permanent role. Ohhh that one
Yes fate of 3000 pax
With andy Chee right
Every week reporting to all the GMs. And every day crisis. But meaningful crisis
So this job is worse
Not aiyo that coffee co tak muat
Coz meaningless crisis
Or aiyo roof bocor
Aiyo why nobody tell me what happened
Or random TM calling me to ask random shit. So we can sell more petrol or buns
Just do a noshow tomorrow on tess call. . Muahhahahhahahwhwwh
At least that stint was important shit deciding future of organisation. And staff numbers etc. Interfacing w GMs and their Minus 1s
U should work on your next move
And setting / shaping strategy
Instead of tess call and the Barrys
My next move is to quietly enjoy 1-2 months to reset. I lost my place already
Oh that’s what her said too
Career wise
U should see your friend. . She was a wreck during her’s farewell
Dont trust myself to make career decisions now
Cried on Monday also coz she saw her’s desk empty
I should hv just left after 1 mtg.. 1 mth not mtg
Ahhahha. . I tot wow 1 meeting
Actually i worked w Zaha b4 your friend did
Maybe that wasn’t wrong either
We joined Global Solutions same time
Eh? Zaha was from IT
She was my CP support and I was the Proj Eng

But i need to be near RLC so can bask in their that doodificence
Kakakakaka. . U mean the other way round. I admire hew for that. Join the nfr team and took his entire team to 31st floor. So they can work in peace. It’s hot desk policy anyways. He knows ppl hv been asking. . . . . 
U know who will rise up here
Let me guess
That is if he wants to stay
that guy. . Lol
No.
U. . Lol
Yap Han Ern
that dood. . What why
that dood too
Apple polisher
Yap got more brains than some of tms put togetger and got some ambition. True lar but that is survival skill
He is economics Ma. . They can’t put a dumb dumb on that role
Just realised brains in retail may be handicap
Is he more brainy than u. . I don’t feel he is brainy
He doesnt seem it but yes
Who is brainier
Him maybe
Cannot be
But he pretend not to be so can fit in better
Why u think so
Dunno.
What makes u think so. . I dunno about that dood
Just a thought but yes maybe that dood can be future big bawse
I feel he is in the wrong company. . Top Chinese
Yes
Toochinese. . Next big bawse is Zahid. that other fellow
Yes was abt to say. He just need to change name. that dood Mahmood
Why. . Lol
Then can ride on other that dood's success
What success

Or he can just give me a few lines
At least he email not on Whatsapp
I didn’t want him to . It will take too long. . He did
As his usual style. What u mean he dud
He had slight dyslexia I feel
Email kan
He did whatsapp me. . Before he emailed. He used to ask help to review his English. He has slight spelling issues. . . . . . . . 
Aiyo. Small thing kan. Is he balling the roll?
Rolling on the ball
rola the bola
I think he missed rolling on the bola. . Now he is just rolling on the flat road
I resume the rola of the bola
Ck made a mistake making him
Why
Still can’t understand why u came back to retail. . He would probably be the only person who likes the Epcm role
I hv been asking myself that everyday since first week
I mean why. . Your window open. U can’t find something else in upstream ??
My window wasnt open
Nobody pulled u back ar. . Like “z ... don’t do it “
My ex boss
Didn’t your friend say anything. . Wtf then ??
I cracked it open
Actually I found out from zamir
W help of my ex boss
Damn kepochi that fella. . Whyyyyyyy

Oh.. What do ppl say of me
Zamir is like “ u lucky u for z”. . Lucky u got Z
Wtf does that mean

I know his wife very well
Super brainy
No lar i so mo liee. *liew. Like Stephen Chow. Everyday talk cock

Zhi's impression of ppl's impression of Zhi. Too detailed. Long winded
Hmmm. . Nadia likes it actually
Too process oriented
She likes your emails
Only cut budget. Make paperwork for that company
This one yes. . But it’s that doodeficial
Arrogant
People tend to skirt around the details. . No la. Maybe sarcastic
Never deliver IRO
Lol
Never support Eng initiatives
Even that guy himself doesn’t believe in it la
Tank lining, Nanovapour etc
But da boss likes u right. . It’s obvious to me
Isit!?
Yes
Too high level
He likes that other guy too. . Not that guy. I don’t hv that vibe
Which is in conflict w too detailed comment. Oh Zhi rely too much on that company. Why never cone to site
No coz u hv data. . And da boss is a mathematician
Need to see my enlarged back door
that guy will just talk high level. . No data
I have NO data that is the problem
U hv more details than that guy. . Got data la
That is low threshold to set
Lol
I think that dude may hv more data than that guy
What?. . I dunno I don’t like that dude either

All of them stopped asking that other guy to book rooms. . I asked them why. They keep asking me to help. Then they said. He send them love messages. . . . . . . 
Why not kau Gary or See. Hansem guys kan.
He likes Indians I think. . that other guy is quiet. So very unassuming
Idea for that company - buat pin up swimsuit calendar. Engineers of that company.
OMG. . Handsome??????

It was suppose to be 8.6. . Poor Shivani
Good lar. Maybe i can overspend a bit and no one will notice. Or vice versa
She really went through hell to get this done ok. . Sigh. Me. Nixdorf. Sigh. . . . . . . 
Yes but now nobody knows what us correct figures for reporting
It was always 8.6M ma. . 2019/ 5.9M
I know but we are relying now on manual adjustment as Sap and Capin and Cleartrack all muddled up.. So now we rely on ADES
Apa itu

Lol. . <Media omitted>. look at this. these are the emails that i ignore. . . . . . . . 
This this is just lazy not my probleming on part of karen

Yes!. True!. Even Chairman and upstream GMs dont scrabble ard like this.
I feel big bawse doesn’t even need all that
When it counts yes but not EVERY FUcking DAy
Just the people down there squabbling about

Do u think RLC knows?
I don’t cAre. . Dkdc. Don’t know don’t care. They not my boss. . . . . . . .

Ohhh this is like the list if who is coming is it
Lol
What for need agenda- got topik oledi ma. So complicated. We just discuss la
Do u think it’s the people they hire ?
Keep it simple for simpletons. 1 topic per discussion. Then no need agenda. No need minutes also
Eh u never exchange notes with that other fellow kah
Becoz action is direct and immediate. Why
He also left retail went upstream now in retail
Aiya i heard he was a bit of joke there. In commercial
Really ????
It was Iain who put him there
Why a joke
He talks tge talk but dunno the work. But ok. Now sell bun
Sounds about right. . Only know how to pressure us. that madam will tell me don’t bother. We diff organisation. Do u know about the Storehub fiasco. I help Catherine to mobilise 80++ because of SST implementation , with contract etc. Turns out we only need a few??. We are stuck with stock now POS everything from Storehub. Wanted to mobilise it for lubbay , thought it will be perfect. Then last week cath said cannot use Storehub , only can use GSS. Yesterday had a call with cath , Shivani, han choong. NO CONCLUSION WHETHER CAN USE OR MUST USE GSS

Lalat omg. . Itu issue lama la
Heard he nvr do epcm or fmc job
He is doing it now in Indonesia. . Epcm. But he was the engineering focal for Malaysia last time
But no major mtce program mar
He helped that guy to stabilise malaysia Epcm
Not mtce
Else it’s worse ok. . FMC nope
Sorry i mean Existing Site brownfield stuff. The bang pintu belakang tak muat
Lol

I think he knows nfr will be a challenge
All of it is. Not 1 thing i done here i hv been proud
It will. . Really not even 1
I am ashamed to be in my job
Omigod
I disappointed in myself.. Could hv done better
Sigh. . We will want to do a farewell for u. I think u must know. U helped many of us. Even if the work sucks, know that you did help many blurfucks here. And that’s not easy as u are supposedly new and only 6 months. . . . . . 
No farewell. I want to quietly leave. Serious
Zaha left me something today quietly
Not sure if i will suddenly melt down and curse everyone
Lol
You only think i am joking
ZhitYou
So many many blurfucks
We should hv a swearing room
Who are to blurfuck to recognise they are blurfuck
Yes I can’t believe how tessy turn it around like “how can u forsake me Zhi “
*too
Yes u r right. . Mich was just sharing with me how blurfuck that weird  lady is
To point until i also question if maybe my 20/20 vision is in error
Asking her whether it was a KUS when the subject title says KUS
Omfg. I was embarassed for her team
U imagine for her. . Lol
Clueless ok but got zero problem solving skills
Coz she doesn’t know she is blur. . Her team is frustrated. that lady will eventually go
Omg she just push to mimi this push that lady that much check this
They learn nothing from her and she keep pushing them
*Mich
They frustrated. . They go to me for steer. Coz they are frustrated
Omg i heard she bullshit to that other fellow that sure can do 40 more site this year in 2 mths
Like u, that lady and that dood keep me in the loop in their emails to that weird  lady
I dunno how
Coz they need me to tell that weird  lady what to do sometimes. . But I can’t do that all the time laaaaaaaa
How does that other fellow not see this.. Tak logik kan. 40 in 2 mths
Coz that weird  lady andthat other galmanage upwards
We do abt ~10+ 1 mth
that other fellow ask for info, they get it from the kuli and pass it off as it they know. . Cannot la. Already said 15 saje
Ku Li Kang
Even that coffee co said. . How can u do 40 by Dec. Stupid. Keep coaxing that lady to tell. . . . . . . . 
No that poor girl said she told that other fellow no ploblem bos. What present Zaha left u
Finally she told all of them CANNOT DO 40. . Just a small Batik pencilbag. Maybe coz I was crying when she left. We don’t know each other well. . . . . . . . 
I think nobody will cry when i go. Except maybe that dude tears of joy
Not like your friend and her
that other guy can be his bro

Why everyone so caring now u leaving. . Lol
Chang Hwee also said he really enjoy working w me.
Wow. . Eh I also enjoyed working with u
To be fair some blurfuck are at least pleasant. Not like Tess. Pushy blurfuck
No more lyingslycowmoomoo jokes. . Really she is pushy. Ppl say she talk like chipmunk
We are bad match. Too similar in style. Opp for learning minimal.
Who are the pleasant blurfucks. . Lol. Pls don’t say it’s me !
Yes a really angry stupid small squirrel fighting for 1 or 2 measly nuts. No lar yr gemilang award bertaburan already. No longer qualified to be blurfuck
So who are the pleasant ones. . Chang hwee I guess. He is very polite and gentleman actually. Always with his please and thanks. . . . . . . . 
Hmm..... Actually hor. Hmm i cannot think who
Jeng jeng jeng. . Lol

Azrin.. Actually he quite smart and hardworking
I got soft spot for him we join shell together. . Same batch. The guinea pigs for cbj global sourcing team
The DO ah pak gang left no impression on me other than they like to sit there read newspaper.
Lol
I also confuse which one is which
Lou san Zhi. . Lol
Lai vs Yee vs Siew vs The One Who Ciao
I used to hv to do work with them and then that madam pill me out. . Pull me out of the DODO stuff. Yee is the limping one. Lai is the other one. Kenny is the one who left. . . . . . . 
Anis seems ok but no chance to really work w him
He is that guye but he sad case. . Kena escalated that’s why he is in hq . Previously ddm

Ahhhhhh same as Shaharina
Oh. that guy pleasant but blur cock
Ahahhahahhahaha
Sha actually never that company she was that other company
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh

Not like June kadir. . Lol
But pity him also. My god everyday wake up what shit to expect next. Bomb scare. Robbery
Exactly. . I dunno June’s real name
Engineering incident
But u know her right
Nope. Who June
Hsse wor. . Fazuan’s wife
Pick Wai very sheltered from day to day noise
Guy that u were surprised I know. . Fazuan
Fahkzan
Ohhhh
that dude
His wife
Ungku. Why suddenly change topic
U were saying about that guy. . Hsse Ma
Hmm. Au seems just seems tired . Waiting to collect VSS
He is like AhPek la
Not inspirational. At least that other fellow try lar
I always laugh when he say something
Shivani just poor thing.
Aiya I love her la. . Last time that dude and that guy ignore and brush her off
Working herself to death and surrounded by dummies in CBJ FO
So we both work together. . So glad Shivani is leaving. She deserves more la
Hope she enjoys SMDS better
It’s a promotion. . Who else
At least more structured and bigger $$$ to oversee
Ck
CK actually quite steady.
Tess ?
Angry small blurfuck squirrel
He old weasel
Ya. He smart about the system
Cecilia ?. . that guy ?. Oooohhh GC?
A bit detached. Holds the line on governance matters which is tough knowing the biz like chinaman sme.. But good she has Shivani, Nat. And now Han Ern. Strong team
Oh but Cecilia actually knows a lot of things. . She quite sharp
Yes agreed. I met her while she was Finance in PD
Few things she told cath to rope me in coz she somehow knew I was doing the Storehub mess. . that guy?
GC. Omg.
GC?
What to say. Myopic but stubbornly relentless. Good for well defined scope.
He told my CM if wanna do success story do it now coz align with their ipf ranking time. . What does good for well defined scope means
But sometimes he tries to hard sell too much. I think he no like me from looooong time ago. We same batch so i dulu retail he trading supply
I tot he was TM. . When u were engineer
He has been around the block. He was crude trader then bukom then retail. No. No overlap. He TM already ciao
He is so unrefined. . I fail to understand how can any woman like him
Unrefined?
I did tell him before
Like uncultured?. What u mean ar
He needs to learn how to speak to female colleagues. . He always say the wrong thing
Why he un D&I to Amy?
Like once he invited that madam for lunch. . Then he said oh but cannot be too expensive. And only if she can make it but not mandatory. that madam was like “ are u inviting me or are you not inviting me?. . . . . . . . 
He clearly hates that guy.
GC ?. . How u know. They both don’t speak to each other in the past - I was their messenger
He prob is the one making Julie investigate me. I mean that company
Aiya it’s obvious. . He has been complaining to me. Almost 1 year
About
And that guy would complain to me. . This thing. I made that guy present it to the gfa team
I am so glad i dont play politik. Zhi jyst wants to get shit done.
Coz GC and Amy couldn’t get him to do it. . Finally GC ask me to help. So I ask that guy to present to Bernard and gang. that guy did it because he was fedup of all the noise and escalations GC made. And to prove he didn’t do anything wrong. Drama. 4 of us use to argue with GC. Me, kenny , that other guy and that guy. . . . 
See that is why i say stubborn
I know. . I used to sit on the same floor and st the back. When I walk over to get water kenny will ask me to come over and reason with GC. Sometimes that dude joins in the fun but that dude gets very red faced and angry. If GC has to confront that guy he will ask me to go along. Shivani said the response on sst from that company is good. And no payment issues so far. So we are good. Missed video call. . . 
You rang?
Error
Talk?
wait. . that dude asking me if can claim for the tax consultant fees for sst. stupid
Try luck mar
Fuckthisshit
I see that you couldn't stand my half arsed response to that guy lar and had to reply on my behalf
Lol
Everything write off
It was more of half arsed response from that guy lar
Fuck yeah
He need to start making decisions le. . Can’t be on iffy cloud all the time. Was I wrong. This was prob why we got all this stock. . . . . . . . 
I think that would work because decisions would imply accountability. It is just retarded we are paying for something that we will never ever be able to use we should cut our losses and get out
Exactly. . If cannot decide then just ask da boss la. We hv a boss to escalate to if we can’t make any decisions
I am cringing at the reply that Nadia sent to us about having to consult with nfr to explain to them the that power company thing.. She is not wrong. (See my _negative negative designed to that dudefuse)_
Mana Ada double negative
Why i dont say she is right. I say she is not right. Not eromg. *wrong. Wro-ght
Ohh
Anyway. I see that dude helpfully putting governance controls so poorly defined that nobody will know if we are following and that dood/Planners will not apply.. And all w zero consultation w me.. Yeah. I also can do flow chart. Got change must agree.. Who coordinates and drives, who agrees ,what thresholds go to whom (assume follow MoA) , what if change doesnt affect cost but functionality etc
Simply do la. . And that guy also never review la
But cecilia say good lets implement.. I am like implement whay. *what. If i make noise they will ssy eh you propose lar
that dood never say anything meh
Blurfucks. He was not consulted. that dude that guy tag team to CK
that dood said he gonna do another Turnkey. . I think he can’t be bothered
that other guy is going to cry.. Indon no TK style
I wanted to witness it tomorrow. . But u got 10am meeting kah. Witness the crying
Maybe i cry
But Indo also cowboy. . that other guy went there to clean up. U know he had to do cp work also
I had really mean ex P&T acquaintance today. Ssid he heard i was leaving on sabbatical.
Coz he and my equivalent Cp not ngam
I asked him what he heard
Wow. . Who is that. I might know. Lol. Fahkzan. . . . . . . 
He said he heard i was running from job responsibilities. No.
Wtf. . Shit

Omg. . What an asshole
Joke only hor
Wtf. . Sounds like GC type
Why retail vely hard meh. Ha ha ha
He come and do la
I starecock him
that dude ask me just ien. . Now. If there is a friction between global and local. Referring to hsse. He ask me why isn’t da boss defending u. since u are new. And why they no cut some slack for u. . . . . 
Maybe u can say got tension. Will make later announcement less surprising. I perceived as arrogant. that guy and Zhi fighting and that guy do smear campaign.. That is why Zhi not invited to Cebu and asked to stay for local wshop
Lol. . No le. that dude has good intention. He feels for u as a bro. Lol. . . . . . . 
Bro-s ??fist bump
But good intention. . Though I didn’t feed him more info. I just said “sigh”
Still wondering how to cascade to L2s. Need to do post Diwali. Shall i announce in nxt FMC PMC mtg. And the invite that other guy to surprise attend. Mid Nov
Hmm. . When is that other guy’s effective date
<Media omitted>. Must go thru OR.. That is why i say mid Nov
That’s not a good gif
Until then cannot speak of it. <Media omitted>. <Media omitted>. Better?
Lol
Maybe will be See's face. He will breathe sigh of relief. As will that guy. I not nurturing leader. So demanding hor
i dunno
Known for my soft style.. *not. But still civil
it will also be a blow for them. . having to adjust to different style- now that other guy style. he's asking if you're leaving. he must hv heard something. that dude i mean. . . . . . . 
Ppl talk
he said he heard from 3rd party. . how come not from me or u. ahaha
Wonder if that other company knows

They might kick out pokka so good timing. . Then cannot lei. Had she got distribution. Logistics chain. Better she go to Retailer and masuk as dealer’s choice. No need royalty to shell ahhaha. . . . . . 
How to do that?
Ask her to approach her nearest shell station. . Put on consignment basis. But declare she is shell etc. If it sells well, the retailers network will recommend within their group. . . . . . . . 
Got anyone she can talk to - Jess?
If no network no point. . They won’t layan her. Has she got a factory. Masuk dealers choice no need to go through hq. Ask her to get friendly with the retailer. And don’t say it came from me. Lol. . . . . 
the birdnest is my sister's and she been asking me how to do it but i forgot to ask even tho i pass by u guys everyday. she already putting at petronas mesra shops. so i can ask her to contact shell shops. the other snacks is under my own distribution company. Thoughts?

Wow

Maybe trucker likes it under shed. . Lol
Then that guy lar said maybe becoz in 2014 there was a Sunny Toilet project under Jimmy Kassim

Pengsan. . Trying to persuade that guy lar not to retender this
Yes. that poor girl's 6am email and Shivani every week working late into night are clearly symptoms of some deep seated issues with how work is managed. *mis-managed
“We are not ok”
This is new Retail slogan ke.. Not "Making Life's Journeys Better"
Go Well = Go Nuts
I think better catchphrase. Aiyo got problem lor. Your profile pic shows your resilience.

It was a pathway in Coventry garden. . I dragged my son with me to get to Monmouth

<Media omitted>
Oh that explains
The Hanged Man is the card of ultimate surrender, of being suspended in time and of martyrdom and sacrifice to the greater good.
Your wife must think u hv gone cuckoo
You deleted this message. When you sense the ‘pause’ coming, pay attention to it; otherwise the Universe will turn up the volume until you can’t ignore it any longer.. pears in a Tarot reading, your projects and activities may be coming to an unexpected and abrupt halt. Don’t keep pushing forward, hoping that more force will drive you to where you want to go. Instead, surrender to the opportunity to pause and view it as your chance to reassess and re-evaluate where you are on your path. Something new is emerging, and you won’t be able to see it unless you allow the time and space for it to come through. Good fit hor
??quite apt. . Maybe u should go get a reading
I hv an app
What ?
Tarot App
Does it work
For fun lar.
Chey
Let me do 1 card reading for that other guy
Do one for me
<Media omitted>. When the Tower card appears in a Tarot reading, expect the unexpected – massive change, upheaval, destruction and chaos. It may be a divorce, death of a loved one, financial failure, health problems, natural disaster, job loss or any event that shakes you to your core, affecting you spiritually, mentally and physically. There’s no escaping it. Change is here to tear things up, create chaos 
Omg. . That’s a bad card. That was quick. Although we need to fill up the entire table. . . . . . . . 
I bcc'ed NR. Yes sure. No shortage of blah blah that i can write up and you can polish
Lol. . I didn’t know that madam is the cp lead apparently
Omg. Early morn i already see 7 mails from you. Your pre Deepavali present for our that company frens?. I must be losing my mind already. Came to work but forgot my wallet so no GID Card need temp pass to get in and need to call IT to get manual password
Need money for food kah

It's all good. Don't worry. Remember the blame Zhi strategy. It will serve that other guy well.
Eh but seriously. . Rlde report alr Ada. TNB recommendation also Ada. Why can’t we start fixing the problem ASAP

Did u hear. . I hv a feeling my source sudah Salah. He might come back and work for ai Kee. It’s more likely. . . . . . . . 
Unless he got shieldtox to kill the cockroaches
Since entire marketing kena reorg ( fuels and brands only)
that guy and that dude very hardy and resistant. Step how also cannot die.
This that dude. . Unbelievable
Why
Told that dood to tender the colo box to the partners
Survivor
that dood ask me to help ..... I am like wtf
Innovative
As if mcD kfc and Burger King are “fighting” for lts1. . Or pelangi indah. I help that dood to draft a few bullet points to Counter that proposal from that dude
Eh. We are premium brand partner
I feel ppl like that dude should just stick to what they do best
<Media omitted>. Which is... what exactly?. He got skill to suddenly buat bodoh/tak tau.
Really. . I think he memang bodoh. that dood also sigh. He has given up. . . . . . . . 
Like how he let joari do his own pump replc selection dunno on what basis and that company cannot reconcile lists/budgets in T&R w that other company listing then he ask back oh why not we follow that other company data.. I say can but what basis and how many 2,4,6 hose etc as all other region ok but orsc messed up and that poor guy Sern said he manually adjust
The planners are just not “planning” properly
He eh got meh oh yaaa got but aiyo not sure so how ar.
Wasn’t it the same this morning. . I felt that dood , that guy and that weird  lady are talking at the same time on different topics
The bloody IPs also cannot settle. Just do big board put in middle of L34, IP target approval date, who in charge, sites firmed, IP drafted, econs reviewed etc.. I no longer read any emails b4 meetings.
I think this joesern is seriously getting himself into trouble
No point as no one else does.. Just masuk simply tembak
Yes that’s how it is
And then since seldom got minutes it's all ok.
It’s getting worse. . Even before u all said it I was already doing the minutes
Is it? No what. There the other day we discussed oledi.. Ok mar.what u talking
Lol
Where got worse
I think I need chocolate
Eh that dood that dood that poor girl why like this
After the meetin f. . that poor girl said she doesn’t even know why she is in that meeting. It should be that dood la
Ok mar. Exposure. Leadershit
Maybe that weird  lady got both of them confused hahahhahahha. . It will never be that lady coz that lady is not in her good books
Great leadershit comes w being inclusive. Oh but sometimes leadershit is also about sending clear messages and consequence mgmt.
U mean being invalid. . Great leadershit comes with being invalid
U too must ASSpire to reach greater heights. Remember 5+3
I m too short
5+3
You know my fren in cp RE. . Asked me to comment on that company. She issued a global rfi for fm in corporate RE. I spend one hour telling her why she shouldn’t consider them. She showed me the jokers representing that company. Vinesh that dude Syazana Andrew Brendan. Syazana they claim to be “PMO”,. . . . . 
Wah. Ok what.. Crack team
Told u cp is awesome. . Bet they didn’t think that i would know. She said she is going to declare that she knows me before the meeting start so they won’t try to bullshit her
I disappointed in that guy lar that other company
I went through their rfi submission and pointed out all the bullshit to her
Apparently since i gave the solar ops mtce to them they hv done nothing
that guy lar also given up
Today i spoke to Adrian thinking conversation already started but apparently no wor
That’s why Even if u do a follow up meeting nobody would. . Progressed
Professed. Confessed. Like that guy. Eh Z say no need ma
And I can’t believe joesern wanna reschedule
Or sometimes to change it up. Eh Z never give instructions. Bz bz man

I am suppose to butt into mint hotel coz site of the future. . But got nothing there le. Sien
See is the PM
Habis la
Yes.. Or rather belum habis lagi ke?. Delays on completion
How is it that despite all the shortcomings See is still assigned more work . I would protest lor. . And only that he has cleaned up all existing load can he then be allowed to take up more
It's the ol' i don't hv anyone else argument and i need to keep him loaded dont worry he is working in a team so is supported by wider that company systems/controls, NTI Bangi ok so far kan ?
He has the experience so should be ok. Moreover he's no longer PM for fuel system in 2019 so big chunk of load is off his shoulders d. . From that dude. He was pestering me about crmm. For tomorrow. I said u not free. . . . . . . 
Friday lar
Do u want to do it with that other guy ?
I dunno.

It won’t be
Wtf. Gsparx also got NDA?
Confusion le
I know. Fucking stupid
Dr cannot keep up
Until my brain also pain
That’s why I wrote a summary email on what’s pending. . I know he start to luan alr. How was the mint hotel thingy. Need cp Mou. Remember I am supposed to butt myself in. But it looks like a non site of the future. All my effort with the previous project manager Tasneem down the drain. . . . . 
It is a site of bleah.. Can you believe that that dude didn't really think through what he was doing with the ev charging. I asked him if he's worked with that poor guy on the monetization model he blank look ah no not sure. You in involved ar?
Omg
I asked that company how they cost for it
Are we doing ev charging in mint hotel ?. . What’s gonna be inside. Don’t u guys hv team meeting
They say that they heard from someone like that weird  lady that roughly hundred fifty thousand no detail no specs
Why like nobody knows what joe is doing. . I was with that dood just now. With that lady. He is equally frustrated. . . . . . . . 
With what. Apparently the planners also don't have a good understanding that there are contractual milestones and best efforts that the vendors apply
I was telling Chiu-Peng I cannot do more than one year in retail. . Before that dood came
Ref Ss6 McD and nti Perasing.. Contractually only 2019Q1 but we are pushing vssb and dk for 2018 year end. You can one. Tmrw Vinesh also coming. I planning to tell them u think at start or end better?. End better
End
Discuss all then fuck u idiots bye. I called that dude abt VO MoC and See nonsense his reply summarised in 1 emoji. ??????
OMG. . Maybe he is resigning too
The that other company also mega dummies. Ask Imtiaz mana itu the KPIs, CRR, PEP.. ??????. ??????
Lol. . that lady would goreng me. If I do that
I try to goreng but these guys came from freezer undefrosted and i ran out of lpg oledi.. Nevermind i serve half cooked call it _al dente_. Or _carpaccio_
Lol. . Cockroach. that other guy balik alr?. So what’s the end of the mint hotel thing. . . . . . . . 
Like dat lor. I drove the point abt solar pv need new agreement in addn to Rela/Sola so we can claim mobey. *money. Good thingthat other galthere
Sigh. . Really?. Or u being sarcastic
She had no awareness abt tmn connaught and dsara jaya. Abt what?
Aboutthat other galbeing there
No. It's good she took an interest.. And we aligned w Chang Hwee , that dood and TM. So picked up sone shit that we wld hv otherwise miss. *missed
Got Drive thru?
Yes
So what is the futuristic part ?
that dood ask got budget for cabling to DT paybox etc. See ??. Not sure. Need to check
Lol
I hate this job soooo much.
Is there anything u like about it. . Think hard
that dood ask me if attending mtg w Starbucks/Texas next week.. I stare cock him and said. Sure caaaan
For the NTI ?
Muscellaneous

Miscellaneous. w that company
Why. . that weird  lady doesn’t even attend. So now u doing that company and that weird  lady job. Lol. . . . . . . . 
I also dunno. Maybe i can network because who knows maybe i will go work for Giant, Tesco, KFC after Shell
Best. . that guy is from
Makes sense
Hahahah
Was he on discount when we bought him?
Lol. . He said he was on discounted rate
I am too expensive already cannot find job outside. Overqualified in areas nobody care abt.
Lol. . That’s not good. Did people understand u today. Masa meeting. There is no projects control in retail. It’s unheard of. . . . . . 
Do u know any majlis/bomba/retail contacts. No but i can facilitate a game theoretic model to stochastically simulate competitive price behaviours
Lol. . Nestle
Apa tu skotastik?. I referred to a shape as trapezoidal.. During mtg.. The special spread
Everyone stare cock u
Then said or is it rhomboid. Hmmm.. (It was trapezoidal). I feel like i want to bagi excel/data masterclass b4 i ciao
We learn in form 1. . Do le
But scared planners will be like ar what is dis ar
Start with basics. . Apa itu IP
Similar to last one but w a few more extras on array formulas, index match and data visualisation. It's sound u make when kena screw by RLC when shit delayed. "IP!"
Lol. . I did tell Catherine. Marketing don’t even know apa itu PO. Why we hv PR process. Why we need contract. Why we cannot do manual PO. I am on another chatgeoup for retail academy refurbishment for the deli2go and select training centre. 80K PO. Now VO of 43K. I asked yen and mich to go through it coz I can’t defend it if I don’t know what they did or did not instruct pca to do. Told them I need to declare it and go back for approval. So hArd to faham ke
Ok what. No need la. Aiyo better ask for more budget. big bawse say must do le. Aiyo so many things ar. Why cannot just be ffp?
What is ffp. . Fuck first then poo?
*fit for purpose but yes yours better. Up butt then up cunt.
Haven’t heard ffp since kenny left
Aiyo wait we didnt sequence right
Yeah la. . Wrong sequence
Nevermind we introduce wash up in middle. Sequence apa tu. Must go fast. Fast fast fast. Do all things all in parallel
Up anus and poo there
Need to generate as much shit to show we are productive
Always kena screw ass
And involve as many ppl as possible. So nanti got victins to blame. There that company never do their work
Always tell her she is like the cheapest prostitute. . Kena screw and by so many and don’t get paid
Eh that company not involved wor. How come they not involved?! poor lady never share proper info at the start
This one I told them not to include that company remember. . So now they got no that company to blame. Sendiri do. Mich steady Wan. But I wanna make them feel the pain. So they will do the same for Ip. . . . . . 
I know i mean it would be funny if default reflex is to blame that company anyway
Yes. . I like to torture them. I alr did what I hv to do the top up the PO. It’s within my governance. But just want to make it hard. Today I screenshot our common friend email on muar oh purpose and ask that dude to tell me what’s wrong with it. And u know. He knows the problem ok. . . . 
What problem?. Ok wat. that lady ask them to go mar
He doesn’t know how to manage that other company. . And rightfully it’s shell to do this le
Who?
that dude
Ar. See engineering how come never do properly
He knows this is that other company
Disappointed in our common friend. Seems like another dud. Cannot make it le.
that dude also said that. . I told him to coach him or ship out
Aiyo so how
that dude knows he gotta do it
I so disappointed in whole dasvroom 2019 IP with that lady Chang Hwee Yee  Vonne Tess.. They clearly totally lost and will just say nah that company made mistake. T&R 2019 list got 37 sites
U defended them ?
But 2018 cannot finish so got 20 or so sites spillover. I say oledi no need re do IP
Seems straightforward
They go write fresh IP including 2018 spillover plus 2019. But then drop sites
Why did planner allow
Now that company list tak matching w what they want in the Iap. Ip. So now they have 47 sites. And i cannot make head or tails of it.
Remove the spillover sites le
37+~20 but drop 10? And some not even on 2019 T&R original list
Hahahha. . Planner should be able to explain it what
Sureeee. It will be aiyo how ar
Habis ? Plan mat lan yeh
I confuse ar
Should put your foot down and make her explain it
Ya lor. I say oledi no need write IP for spillover sites as that company already got PO. Just write for new ones. Aiyo Zhi why you abandon us. Remember the call
Because u can and u will
The only will is Z will leave
Because u lot is incorrigible
Good fucking luck  to all of you. No no. Zhi is not adaptable. Not flexi enough

Nooooo. . I don’t want to be tooooo available for him. I rather go level 3. And sit around and muck. . . . . . . . 
My write up. _Zhi is fucking tired of this shit and decided he had enough. Thank you Zhi for your limited contribution and time here and good fucking luck that other guy you will need lots of it and patience(lots of patience)_. Image of Zhi w rwo middle fingers extended. Good way to end my +15 yr career
May u all continue to ffp

Pass all your “how ar” queries to that other guy. . Signing out with lots of “up yours”, Z

He said issue warning letter. da boss look at me said. I am looking at my cp is that good enough ???. He fucking playing with Kantha today. Kept on stare cock him. 
Small cock or big cock

Kantha a bit less skillful cockcroach
Dropped as a baby wat. . I felt I could goreng better. that guy not allowed to help
Was talking to my spouse who is very concerned i am losing it and being self destructive and besmirching my otherwise good standing.. Said maybe better just pretend to be sick and dont come in rather than come to office and be passive aggressively sarcastic. Sarcasm that apparently largely goes over the heads of people it is intended for
Hmmm. . Listen to her. Aggressively sarcastic. I hope u not like that at home. . . . . . . . 
This shitty job has affected me deeply
U shared the email with her ? The one to anis
Ok tmrw and Mon i will suddenly fall sick and not turn up. And turn off phone
Not tomorrow !!
Yes
U know SHe is right. . <Media omitted>
Nobody will own up to doing this. that dude look at me. that guy will shrug. Handover to Zhi already ma
You right. . If that madam know. She will tell me don’t bother it’s Not a cp contract
Zhi will be holding it until that other guy gets here. No way i can implement.. that guy will say eh i already help by getting retailer to sign.that other galsays retailers will compare so all solar site must hv 1 year free. Goid hor. *good. I might as well say ok lor. Waive 1 yr
Eff
Epcm mgr job got a lot of authority. I say support means ok

Brokem. . Broke and lem. Ask her about your pic. On your announcement. I show it to your friend and she said tell Zhi it’s a lame pic. Ahhahhaha I told your friend that’s what I wrote to u too. . . . . . 
Yes. Ending career on lowest of low notes. Like super bass note. Audible to dogs and sea mammals only.
that dude just texted me. . Said he cannot believe u are leaving. He asked if someone Pissed u off and he hoped it wasn’t him lol. You need to get a grip of yourself , find a way to manage it. U going cuckoo. . . . . . . . 
Only need to last a few more weeks.
Just curious. . Have u spoken to your mom. Or dad. They know u the best. . . . . . . . 
Who say wan
Just assume. . They know u all their lives
But yes at first they were not keen on me leaving but they heard me bitching and then reconsidered.
I mean they know u since birth. . Ah seee they know
Dad said take time to learn to better manage finances and investment. Now my shares like gambling only.
Ahhahahah. . Wow. Maybe u can give us a class
He is big on value investing

<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>. . Front le. Your role is epcm Manager
<Media omitted>
Lol. . Are u feeling better. Mic called me. that guy. . . . . . . . 
I copied that guy's big bawse mc so no one sign wor mail
I had to point out the grief he caused u
Nah. He prob doesn't recognise it.
He did. . I pointed it out. He didn’t know
See. Told you
Learning for him. . I said next time read the pack properly. He said it’s not there
Learning on what exactly ?
To read and comment properly. . Not just give blanket statement
Nah. Zhi must learn to write better mails. Shorter
He also must learn
See even this new one so looong. I writing now for that other guy's that doodefit.. My upstream p&T colleague said my handover and filing was very helpful. I did similar thing w him when i handed over in Mar
Wow. . U set the bar. For handover
Sad hor
Yes. . Sad
But apparently panjang email no good in near term but great for auditability to trace why certain things decided or chronologizing shit.
Yes
So yeah.
I like it. . Me ok. Beats reading manuals
Joari only person who is using my departure to diss that guy
Like how
There the email i shared. ... _feel Zhi is more open and understanding. but the again a joy short lived for us SnO folks._
He replied
?. Who. What
Where he wrote this
No this morning diff email
Omg. . He wrote that
Re: Construction / Renovation at RASUSA Enterprise.
I din see this
Check your inbox. It's Joari bitching but essentially saying Z better than that guy
Oh that one. . For my entertainment tu
Ya. Entertained?
I am mega spring cleaning. . It’s my Friday thing. I clean to destress everyday. I am ocd remember. It’s prob the only thing I hv in common with that guy. We both like to organise our house stuff. . . . . . 
How does this not translate to his work stuff
Exactly. . I ask him before
I cannit understand
He said he was before. . After the 3rd and 4th year he gave up
Like one of the ex admin lady. Everything suuusaaaah ni i dah confuse but suddenly when calculating her package she was super sharp and then she left to do small biz after
Ohhhhh
Actually i admire that guy. He is super resilient and clearly has developed superior methods of self delusion so he can go around saying ok wat - quite good oledi and aiya why that company/that other company/Retailer/other ppl never do properly. No need to reflect back on himself and ask maybe i missed something. And he has gotten away with it. Not sure what his IPF was though.
It good. . Not good. Who does your ipf
It good not good?
Rlc right
I dunno
Not good. . This is sarcasm ???
Noooo of course not. There is a brilliance to his impreviousness. *imperviousness. Or how nothing can stick to him. Like Teflon Man. No responsibility/accountability can attach itself to him unless it's a positive one
Ck doesn’t like him. . Joari doesn’t like him
So who does
Hmmm. . Nobody. I don’t think anyone hangs out with him. Maybe the network ones. that other guy is ok with him. To be honest I think he is a loner. . . . . . 
I also quite private dude
I think he worse than u
Notwithstanding my 3838 ness
Hahahha
that lady said omg Zhi you really chee seen. She thought i always serious
Tercall. . Sorry. Lots of ppl now know u r 38. that girl too after the little episode u had with her. . . . . . . . 
What episode. Now season ender
U came over and made her laugh
But show cancelled
Stand up comedian
Why push so hard on solat.
Lol
Nobody cares. Oh wait suddenly now they do
Making a mental note to make sure everyone gets their job done le
Shit. *solar
Eh Nadia kept to her word lei
But Solat for that guy/that dude
Must give her that
TRUE
In between all the nfr shit she has to do for multiple cp and bid. . She damn good. We have that bid case with her which she is working wirh external lawyer the ppc story. And several rubbish contracts with CR team. And my ev charging lou. And colo rubbish also. . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
Did u hear from khimbok after he submitted the CVA@ 51points
<Media omitted>. nope
Should I send a chaser. . I wanted to on wed
Dont worry Hadri good fren w Ir Chen
But I wanted to check if he had verbally updated u
For sure pass. Nope
I still wanna pester him
Be my guest. See looked relieved.. Yesterday
Oh I spoke to him and Gary. . Apparently Vinesh did really offer him a role as cpm in Indonesia. Even See said Vinesh is crazy. Told him he has non performance. And that shell complain about him but offer him to be cpm in Indonesia. . . . . . . 
Mad Cow Disease
Plus See’s daughter is autistic so he is in no way can relocate
Staaaphh no more chaser mails on wkds
Lol. . Ran out of things to clean. Eh makan lunch or not
Aiyo saw too late
Why
Because i no see my phonr
We haven’t gone yet. . Let’s go
<Media omitted>. This shit. Already at meal station
How is that related to lunch. . Christ
No relation.. Just things that irritating me.
Who u makan with. . Lol
Some upstream ppl
It’s an irritating day to work
Your unofficial network very power. I heard da boss replc is that guy too.
Wah. . Everyone knows since last week
I didnt know. Not that it matters
Actually I also don’t care. . We diff organisation. As that dood say. We workfor shell. Not for the boss. . . . . . . 
But that guy is having a meteoric rise in career. Another "favorite" _ala_ that other fellow
I hv never worked wirh him. . Do u think we need a discussion with joesern on the dovamo he submitted. I tot we asked for more scenarios ? Or is this good enough to make the case. <Media omitted>. why the hell are we doing the self invest model then. we may as well just bank everything on TNB. only sleep with one partner. . . . . 
It's ok. Let that guy sort it out. Sure he can defend the pilot economics. I must fix potholes before I ciao. You know. The real work. Not thus low carbon bullshit. I am on leave 10-17dec, 24dec-8jan, 20-31st jan. Not much time left.
i tak faham why the ROI is NA for Scenario 3
Looks like nothing will be resolved before i go anyway. The Gsparx and that company jokers back forth and induction (and hence site survey) only happening post Xmas. You copied right? Apparently whole world needs to know their logistics arrangement and that dude's internal exchanges w Ghaus.
I saw. . Efff. Freaking joke. this amongst all my other stupid emails. feel like i've not left work since last night. that lady asked me today. wat was my expectation for ipf. . . . . 
Nah. This role and almost everyone i hv to work with is the joke.. The sad part is they dont know it. And i am the kena punch line
my response was i'll accept whatever that was fought for. . i think it's good to laugh about it, but it's only so much one can laugh about
Laughing who's laughing?
i was at first
I am grimacing in pain
but i'm geram now with all the stupid emails
Now i hv completely lost it
your wife is right
Abt what
About taking a breather. . Take leave. Sick leave
The sad part is other ppl outside will look at thus and say ok ma cheh what so hard abt this?
I know what u mean
Like dis also kenot ar
I was in the lift
Which us true
Someone from finance was trying to impress this girl
*is true
And was talking about retail capex. . About u managing capex 40M. And the girl said Wah so much. The guy said “ no la it’s not a lot. Got contractor mah”. Girl said “ yeah but still”. Guy said “ no le they also hv planners to manage everything “. . . . . . 
Yeah wat. Ok ma. How come ar Z cannot kaotim these that company guys
OMG. . I think these are the cbj Finance ppl
He cannot make it isit?. No wonder he opting to leave. I cannot wait to see what bullshit that dude can cook up to justify KUS IP VO-s
That one omg. . What kinda report is that. I don’t even know why there is a VO
And i think that other company no hope oledi in terms of them tryimg to do E2E and KPIs. that dude was right. Shld hv bitten the bullet and pull ALL works away from them. Rather than my slowly slowly bagi chance approachm
And then give it to that company. . Same also le
At least that company slightly better paperwork. Bar the errr urmmm see that's why got VOs. "See" that's why. There are fundamental issues and makes me think if this year less capex i already dig up all this shit is it more likely that all this while that guy has managed the contract better or has he buried the shit more thoroughly?
He buried it more
If he got away with it then does it peversely justify his actions?. See Z must more pandai pandai
He didn’t care enough to report it back to anyone
As Cecilia says. Zhi very honest
Nobody checks on him
You hv to ask if da boss wanted this plausible deniability..m. Biz happy mar. Use capex anyhow
I dunno. . Everyone likes to sweep things under the carpet
Carpet bulging.
And cp is seen as people
h the carpet. No lar. Maybe that trophy now goes to me.
Yes. . We were digging in nfr
To stay means i become normalised to this bullshit
And fuels
Han Ern has 12 PIRs he wants to do in 2019.. Good luck.
Wow. . Well it’s the others who gotta do the write up
that company will obviously become punching bag
Who’s gonna do it
And Z being in absentia will likely have my name smeared
12 PIRs - siapa Wan
Dkdc. Planners cannot get their shit right. Biz no clue just want money and excuse to blame why sales/volume tak naik.. Middle mgmt happy to live w inefficiencies. And play politik by spouting lofty principle arguments that border on truisms but do not translate into actual policy changes or consequences on decision making/accountability when shit goes wrong.
Sigh. . To be honest I kinda snapped also last week
Wtf zhi. These are serious accusations. What are your examples?. Oh i dunno. How the frick has that weird  lady been given MORE responsibility?
Hahahhahah. . She can’t even cope with existing
that guy has challenges w governance/process mgmt. Oh i know let's elevate him to global position covering design governance
Sounds like promoting See to Indonesia as cpm story
Must keep him motivated to unlock all that potential. Ok wat. Sounds like a right legit strategy. Sly cow already strategizing how to play out Zhi/that other guy , CK/that guy transition to their that doodefit
Well they always think they got us figured out. . Except that dude
He never book the CRMM or Q4 engagement.
He knows I always stab him. . I did. It’s in Dec
Betul ke becoz Z is an open book
Dec 3rd
Well note my leave days
I did
I am on vacay 10-17
I open your schedule. . Your handover schedule
OK. This Thu/Fri i asked that other guy to return here for Network Planning big 2019 wshop. He said kenot. So dunno what shit that guy and team will crap out.. <Media omitted>. <Media omitted>. I was like wtf is this Item 14. Solar+ _EV charging_. And 15. LED???? We already hv this shit
Lol. . GoCar also done deal la
And how is 8. Recommission Idle Tank supposed to help yield.
And gocar npthingto do with network also
I ask Tess said oh quick win wat. Go Car promos on all TV Screens now
So laffable la. . Who did this slide
I wish them all the best . Please focus on your believes. Becoz that's prob all you will hv
I tak faham the taglines at the bottom. . What is that. Performance orientation. Honestly. Honesty. Respect. How come sounds like gaya mutu dan keunggulan taglinrs. . . . . 
Our core values in Shell. H.I.R. Tak pernah dengar ke?
Why is it on this slide. . And ahneh colours some more. Wtf
I dunno. Ask how we will *differ* permanent site closures
Hehehe. . Yes let’s differ it. Half close. Full close. 25% close. Lol. . . . . . 
Racist!
Lol. . Did u watch Sheldon. Him as a kid. He protested when he lost a science competition. He protested to Mediocrity. . . . . . . 
It's hypocritical. All our fancy behaviours and values cacat-ed in real life
I kinda did that when I snapped. . I went to that lady. Highlighted on some management mediocrity. 1 hour with her. . . . . . . . 
that dood damn angry with CK. Worried that guy will be apple polisher and more concerned abt making sure big bawse happy than allowing ppl space/freedom to do the workm
that dood will just rant
Ask why da boss no decency to tell us directly
He might leave he said. . I think u inspired him. Aiya it’s suppose to be embargoed la
that dood can prol survive in professional chinaman company
Hehe
Unlike me
He is better suited to be self employed
I cannot make it unless i work in audit for some big conglomo
Well u will now make a great consultant. . Having been in retail
I was already that even b4 retail.
I mean now u went to the worst side
Wife asked me to think positively abt what i learnt over last 8 mths.. I am drawing a blank.
U know what a company should not do
Resilience and tolerance ?
U know how things can go so badly and how everyone is warped and disillusioned
Ok wat. C5 on target 240 vs 215 m USD. Must be doing sonething right
Warped
Ok ma we are still No 1
Hahahha your wife really keng la
Growth mindset. https://youtu.be/KUWn_TJTrnU
Yeah so I went to that lady for “growth”
Can look at this as failure and bad career choice
How she should upskil the people around her. . To help me. Help her to help me. lol. . . . . . . . 
OR a learning opportunity and self reflection
I think if anything it only pushed u to your boundaries
Aiyo but my pothole how ar
And made u take the unchartered path whatever it may be. . To see when things are bad how u can turn it to an advantage to yourself
My pothole HSSE le
Lol
So my pothole u can fix. Thank you so much ar
U query them back Ma
The ppl who survive are tge simplest
Kenapa got pothole
*the
No lor. . I don’t want to be a cockroach lo
Cockroach strategy memang power
Too many in cp la. . I tak mau
No head can still survive for weeks
Do u know Elysia Yeo
Operate on instinct aje
Cp
Wah canggih namanya
She used to be good. . Masuk upstream she became like cockroach. Survival mode
Ok wat. Got gaji.. I cannot live w myself
Me and your friend sama school. . We just not wired itu Macam
Then be prepared to be frustrated.
I am but I hv destress mechanism. . Lol
Yes. I praise your principled leadership approach.
Skip?. . The Skip thing issit
Apa itu skip
Go one up if line manager doesn’t listen. . Then what u mean by this
Is it skip=trip=pukai
Hehehe it’s a HR tool in shell. . We have  Skip session in Cp. What u meant by this
Principled leaders are those who articulate their values, make decisions guided by their values, and consistently live their values in a transparent manner, all while clearly adhering to the ethical codes and standards of their environment.. I try to do this. This is why i sound like professor
Are u dissing me or u mean it ?
No lar. U joking ke. You are my strongest ally
Really ke ?. . If I am your strongest then jialat - I am not even in your organisation lol. We are all about difficult conversations and confrontations. In a healthy way. I don’t like to be frustrated with my colleagues so I just go straight to management and trash it out. I don’t report to yiboon but so far all the other cp depts I was in, all the leaders were open to listen to constructive feedback.. That’s why when that guy called me on Friday after u “Z decline to speak”. I just tell him straight. That the last thing u need is for him to be some smart ass giving half hearted blanket statement that does not help. . . 
More accurate that he got nothing more to say
In fact after I sent an update on the azimuth
Which clearly not true for him. He got lot to say on everything
He did write back to me only this time. . He did listen
Good lor. I am so happy for him
He asked if we engage with the renewable energy ppl under that guy. . And that other woman's team. I was like thank god u had to sense to write to only me - but yes pls do not go to Zhi with this kind of suggestion. We hv enough neethis. . . . . . . . 
Ok ma. He just trying to be helpful.. How he know who engaged or not
I told him. . I asked him if his intent was to be helpful he could just call. No need to email entire world. He noted that I was right about that. . . . . . . . 
Very that dood of you
Lol
I dowan to see his face no more
Clearly his intent was also to that dudeon show he smart la
that guy i mean not that dood.
He knows that. . I told
irst. Oh good. I thought maybe that was unclear
Else I told. . I asked him about the mint hotel thing. And he said that dude never shared with him the ip layout until that day. I told him to do a self reflection why ppl are starting to exclude and forget him. I din wait for him to answer and I said that it’s because he is half involved and half interested. In everything whether he was in the previous role or current role so cannot blame that dude if he is not top of his mind!!!! Lol. that dude is not clever to begin with. . . . . . 
that dude also funny fella. He didnt involve me in a number of NTI discussions went straight to that guy .
Nfr hates him
I told that guy  to keep me looped
He likes to come and be a jerk to them. . Damn hamsap also
He is damn funny. Esp when he think he got good argument (but doesn't) and tries to bullshit his point
Like I said - not clever to begin with
Best part is that sadly sonetimes i also shocked nobody challenge him
I am not as smarty as u , but I do raise my hand when I don’t understand something
Likethat other galalso uses a lot of half baked logic
Lol. . that weird  lady almost half the time lost the plot. That kinda mode. GC also. He would come to me. And same wit that guy. . . . . . 
that weird  lady totally not cooked. Like eating raw flour and water
I always tell them if u want me to comment be ready coz I can only do honest truth
At least Half Baked can eat crust
How to do this effectively is to just stay true to yourself always. . I remind Catherine over and over again. The opex and sp&a shell’s money and not that other fellow or anyone’s money. She is always faced with dilemma what she should do and always come to me. I always remind her. It’s not our money. . . . . . 
Oh good lor. You are seen as confidant and good advice dispenser. I am seen as advisor to give good dispenser
Lol
Can la. This site pam so ol oledi.
Problem is not everyone comes to me
Change lar. Z can decide
Need everyone to be on the same page. . Baru can be change agent
I happy if the book in same language
Now people like me are just irritating agents. . Irritants. And u are just the “honest” agent. We are not “progressive” agents. Innovation agents. Innovation agent is like that other fellow. that lady always shuts me off when I talk about how annoying reporting is for me because the reports are requested from diff ppl in different format but same info. I still nevertheless brings it up at every other opportunity like sps review, team meetings, east meeting lol- hence the irritating agent. So whatever u think that u are doing wrong in retail, you are not. Stay true to yourself and your principles. A hundred people say that u are wrong doesn’t necessarily mean u are wrong u know.. I hope u know that. And not let this short stint in retail breaks u. . 
Trying hard but you've seen my descent into madness over last few months.. Starting from. Oh great new job
Yes but you are better than that
Eh why like this wan. Hmmm...is it me. Everyone seems to think it's ok wor
No not really
Hey cannot lar like this
Lots of people hv doubts but just too tired to say anything
To now: Blublublublublub
U should give yourself a pat in the back for being persistently honest
<Media omitted>
Mustask that dude
Pat on the back or slap on forehead?
Must ask that dude
Abt what.
What he thinks is wrong with retail. . Did he tell u
Fish dont see water
So he is water. . Wah
Same like See dont catch water fish. Ref Cantonese phrase "chuk leh sui yu". Directly translated, it means "poke you water fish". Awater fish is described as someone really gullible or easily manipulated
So funny that See also found it preposterous that Vinesh offered him cpm role in Indonesia. . Ohhhh sui yu
Yeah announcement dah keluar. You terima?
I saw her fiddling with your announcement
Saw?
When I went to give her bunga telang
Yeah formatting wonky.
Yeah I didn’t get the announcement. . We hv been removed from your org email group. Fwdto me pls
Oledi.
Can’t see pic. . Did u use the one with the hard hat
<Media omitted>. No iupdated
Lol. . I personally hate all these kinda announcements. It’s so formal and yet try to be personal. They always make u end with a liner what u like to do. As hobby. . . . . . . 
I heck care. My first draft. After 15 yrs Zhi has decided fuck it whatever.. Bingobox. Sustainable model ke?
Eff the Bingobox. . Mich ask me to review her ramp up plan for Bingobox I just cannot man. My ramp up plan I told her do the “See if u can Beat the Bingobox”. Means outsmart it. Hehehhehhehehhehehhehe. . . . . . . 
Put me and Cher inside same time. Error error
Lol
You cannot *_wo* -man_
Hahahhahahha
International Man day yesterday
Isn’t it next week. . Wtf
I going to attend i not ok talk
Oh it’s ongoing ?. . I think u should - who knows , maybe u will have an a-ha moment
A-ha or ahahahaha dragged away in strait jacket moment
But is your wife concerned about ur mental health ??
<Media omitted>
She would know best if u are going cuckoo. . I wouldn’t take light of it honestly. Reason why me and your friend are always together - we keep each other sane
Yes. She thinks i've gone completely unhinged. Worse than the Biz Advisor To Chairman year. And that was a bad yr
Oh it was ????. . Why ???
Yes. Intense
But it was still fulfilling ?
But at least high stakes and meaningful. This one is oh toilet pothole tangki bocor. And solar bullshit.
It’s still meaningful. . Just on a different level lor
Is it really. RLC will see econs and say eh why we invest if econs so shit
Then don’t do lor. . No need to defend
Hey why u need 8 mths to decude ar
Rlc should also hv the guts to call it off. . Let me tell u a story
A long time ago in a galaxy far away...
Hahha. . U remember 98/99. Was the year when the crisis happened. I am a twin remember ?. . . . . . . . 
Yes but i was not working yet
We both had no money to continue our studies so we took a break. . 2000 was also another
Another?
Again we both took half a year break. . Another crisis. Finally after we both got our degree. I took another year off. Before coming back to malaysia. Doing nothing particularly great -. I think it was till today the best thing in my life. Soooooo , u taking this break could be IT. . . . 
What exactly was it
I was working illegally. . In New York
IT as in Data Science?
Waitressing. . Having the time of my life
Wah. Sounds teruk. Like 2 broke girls
Learning about wine and fine dining
The show i mean
My sister went to Swansea
Wales
Yes
Ulu punya tempat
She holed out there to find a job. . As chemical engineer. I went back to New York to make money. I was there before 9/11 and after 9/11. . . . . . . . 
During?. Or luckily managed to miss it
I used to take the train at World Trade Centre for a year plus. . Missed by a week
Oh shit. Wah
I went back to Canada. . My frens were there. They got a day off
Wait. Where u go uni?
Lol. . Canada
How u end up in NY?
Take a bus
Nowhere nearby
Pass Maine , pass Boston all the way to NYC. . First time I went there I worked in Annapolis. Go to Chinatown , go to agensi pekerjaan. Then they found me a job in Annapolis. Terrible job. By the 2nd month I found another job in New York. I could go on and on about the adventure. I think the point is that. I didn’t really feel sorry for myself - just knew I had no money so work lor. But it did turned out to be one of the best thing ever. I made friendships that last forever and learn things I can never learn elsewhere. So consider your sabbatical a “gap year”. Lots of ppl asked me what u are gonna do after this, and I say I dunno , maybe nothing, go ask Zhi la
<Media omitted>
Eh one of the 7 brothers. . Or was it 10 brothers
I dunno but i know the dude as everyone's uncle in tvb dramas
7 brothers. . Part of Jackie Chan’s posse I think
Only found out later he was this kung fu actor. Even Tarantino paid tribute to him. In Kill Bill he had a bit role
He died ke
Token chinese sifu
Yes I remember. . Lame
Yeah. Stereotyping
Eh u get my story ke. . The gap year thing
Yes. Pendek kata stay positive and look fwd.
Eh no. . Make full use of the gap year, u may surprise yourself. And rediscover yourself. Aiyo. . . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
Ish. . U Salah alr. Not asking u to be positive. But take advantage of this break. . . . . . . . 
Ok. Msg rx. Rxd. Tq for being a concerned fren
It’s too cliche to tell someone to be positive.  U know that right. . It’s like telling someone eh don’t be sad la when the mother passed away
At least you didnt ask me to turn to islam.. To commemorate today's holiday
Of coz not -
Eh. You berani nak cabar islam!. Berani nak cabar ketuanan bumiputera!. Ambik ni
I don’t dare to say this. . But
Badish bsdush
My mom always tells me. . If anything happens, u think prayers can help ar ??
Can wat. Look at us school shootings.. All the thoughts and prayers are so effective. Gun control?. No way.
It’s do or die. All up to us . Fate is in our hand and all the prayers won’t help. . If there is a problem, I wasn’t brought up to find god, god will lead the way blablabla
On unrelated matter, i asked that poor guy for admin access to Network Sharepoint. I want to show we can automate shit using O365 and SP built in workflows and dynamic list sharing. My last contribution to team and practice for potential future career path. So no more random emails rewuesting shit. No more mutiple files and back forth shit. Who has final revision etc. Hopefully can show if we give 3rd Party Access we can automate further.. Right now it is an admin burden/hassle
So gung-ho. . Guess what. that lady finally cannot tahan me. As I did not keep asking her for my ipf. She tot I would pester her. She finally told me mine 5mins ahi. Who. Ago. . . . 
As Nitinder already confused on who's who. Why not u send him a msg saying the 25% upfront may be sometjing we are interested in...The only thing is even if NPV good whether we hv the Opex to spare as this was not in original T&R. Not sure why Aznan suddenly resent the proposal
Sigh. . Tomorrow I tell u
Oh no. Sounds like more ??. Dont worry i immune oledi
I follow up with Nitinder on the commercial. . He forgot. What we spoke masa we were at TNB
I irritated w that guy lar tadi. I wrote to him and also told him abt uncomm tank issue and for him to amnesia tadi too much.
Sigh. . I know
But wait Aznan just resent same thing no?
Yes. . Sigh. Tomorrow I call him. Had no time to explain to him. Maybe I too short he cannot remember what I daid about management wanting more rental fee. . . . . . . 
As i said. Good to know clown school has many graduates in both the private and GLC sector
But u had no heart to diao him further. . He clearly din do much with your email. Or no time. Or it didn’t register to him what he has to do. Or he didn’t understand why u needed him to make it happen system wise so there is traceability. . . . . . . 
I spoke to him at length in person
His weakness is follow through and decision making. . It was different with kenny
But insightful talking to that other guy. As i can see why he has been having a few ah so you know the problem, solution seems straightfwd , why didnt u fix it yet ?
He wanna understand the challenge. . To u or that guy lar. I uploaded the contractual obligation and kpi for quality where we can “hurt” that company in the handover to FMC. Uploaded into your onedrive. Need to make a mental note about hurting them when they claim fir bonus. . . . . . . 
that company or that other company?. Both
Both. . U think when that poor guy Sern can finish the econs. We hv to do Steerco alr
Nah. Tak sempat i think.
??
Remind me to book week 3rd Dec but if miss then it's wk 17th
I Book
that poor guy got a lot of stuff to do
I drag everne including joe. . Drag everyone
Siape tu?. New colleague
Type too fast
Who's bad habit?
Lol
She a millenial ?
I wonder what is that other guy thinking
Ok wat. Why Zhi cannot make it?
No le. . that other guy is humble
Then i also dunno
He knew it’s gonna be hard
Thankless is how i would phrase it.
Thankless but tankful- uncommissioned ones
I see my main contribution this year has been teaching ppl to make bad puns
Who else is doing that
That dude. Something something. Sits at back of that lady
Whooooo. . Whoooo is dis. When u left the room, that guy lar said eh Zhi is frustrated. U know I am incapable of being sarcastic so I just say of coz heis. . . . . . . . 
omfg.. Heis?. Oh he is. But why ar?
that guy lar is itu Macam. . Like berserah to takdir type
 ?? ??? ?????
This that weird  lady. . We have milk supply issue. Before I can check on the specs that weird  lady ask let’s go to Sabah. While I admire her gung-ho-need. Ness. . . . . . . 
Go do what unless you can produce milk directly
I said we haven’t even check the milk specs and I need the milk to be tested. . And submit the certification for that guy to review. Before we go for site visit. Pengsan. . . . . . . . 
I say oledi FFF. Fast. Flexible
And Fucked
Furious (Passionate). Fanatical?. Fanatically passionate
Farked
That is later. Dont worry once fucked pregger and deliver then milk will be a normal biological outcome
Imagine reporting to her
Shudder. But actually may be easy to manipulate.
I did. . But. To the advantage of the team members
Hey i thought of Retail 3 Fs. Fast Flexible Fanatical. That is good set. *F* luffy *F* orgetful (Un) *F* ocused
Frantic , Frivolous, Farked
I like. Our energy efficiency target magically improved by 50% in 2017 w out hvg to do anything. Apparently due to a definition thing where TnG reclassed into certain NFR SAP coding , NFR revenue grew 20-40% per site so suddenly the Kg CO2/ NFR Rev in MYR decreased by 50%. No need Solar or all the other things.
What
Magiccc. 2017 is abt 50 vs 2016's 111 kg CO2 / MYR baseline. Success. We studied the problem away. Hurray
This is crazy. . How can tng suddenly reclassified. This must be Catherine ahhaha. Or that poor girl. . . . . . . . 
Yeah. Global prob not going to buy this either. But has to do w SAP Faster Line Codes and what we defined as NFR Revenue
Hehhehe
Yes. Natalo
Lol
U been talking to Cat
Nope. . I can guess. Siapa the magic makers
Suddenly she wrote me a maol saying been hearing good things but shame no chance to work w you and good luck bye bye. ?
Cath???. . She wrote to u??. Coz she saw your announcement ??. Me and her talk nfr saje. She got a lot of rubbish to deal with in nfr. . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
Today she came to me about payment for a workshop with Nielsen that the nfr team went. . And cannot pay. Coz they didn’t know Nielsen contract is for data and we barter trade with our data so no transaction. Wow where she heard the good things about u from. . . . . . . . 
I also dunno. Maybe she tot i was Cher?
Hehehhehe. . No la
<Media omitted>. <Media omitted>. Even not at work i cannot escape
Lol. . How funny. I just donated all the peter and Jane books. My son said it’s so boring and to prove his point he told me to read it. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1387007608097233&id=285116394953032. World toilet day. . . . . . 
U semangat la. Go Solar. So that guye write summary digest for Uncle Singh and Aznan
With Nadia now. . On the modular shit. So that guye of that guy to just send that dood here
What modular shit. Starbx?
Yes
Why i not informed? Not that i care
Sigh
Wat is the issue. Why got legal?
Colo need to revise the agreements. . It’s a business contract. So normally that dood will go to nadia and ask me to go too. There is a colo meeting now at 28. Dunno why that weird  lady call for the meeting. that dude ask me to join. . . . . . 
?
Now they going through status of the DT
Wtf is going on.
I will update u
Was i excluded on purpose
They want to discuss ways of working
As i am leaving?
that dude was excluded too. . He decided to join
Which is cool
I don’t think I am really required here
Was i required. Wait isnt the Colo mtg after lunch. The our common friend/that lady show
I dunno. . This is like that weird  lady adhoc meeting
FFF
<Media omitted>. . that lady...
t there is an average 6 % increase every 3 years ( as base tthat guy is revised every 3 years..). minus cost saving from 1.6 % from green fund and ICPT cost of 1.35 cents @ kWh.... <Media omitted>
But why Laziness. . <Media omitted>
Cannot. Got Network 2019 Workshop this morning.
I know 2 Of them
That i plan to turn up 30min late for
They inviting assholes to be speakers. . Wtf
Butt why?. Becoz Shell invests heavily in gas
Yes farting good stuff. . This the one wirh Tess?
Yes.. da boss also seems to be not bothered and letting YT do whatever
Siapa YT. . Ohh. that guy
Depressing. Not sure if that guy will shake stuff up
I wouldn’t bet on it. . There was also some issues I heard about colo trying to get the NTI timelines. that dood doesn’t wanna give it to them. Ask them to get from that company. . . . . . . . 
Why ?
Project manager Ma. . I asked that weird  lady. She said she wants the km/bp timeline and opt. Otp. It will help colo to get partners on board coz partners will want to know. They expect colo to get partner to sign the Tenancy Agreement. Big mess. Legal alr said no. It’s been a frustrating mess in colo DT. . . 
? Why?. Shldnt everyone know when contractual h over date is?. We already hv issues becoz we target OTPs earlier than contractual dates but LV not obligated to go faster. Eg Perasing and Lot 4 SS6 Mc D. <Media omitted>. Was he not in Azimuth meetings?. That comment abt we dont get single cent ...
Sigh. . U ask him to ask me. Why he suddenly decide to bug u
I triggered him
I saw hahahaha. . Give him some work
<Media omitted>. Zhi... NPV 8 % with ICPT fixed at 1.35 cent @kWh and  1.6 % KWTTB saving....
Apa ini
I dunno uncle singh sent
U the numbers guy wor
Me? I only know 1 number. 43496
Cis
My LDOP
I had to move the crmm. . that other guy cannot make it. that guy- highly interested to discover japan again. OMG. So fast u forgot to cc me. . . . . . . 
Sorry
Sorry what sorry? Who sorry ? Or better yet, why sorry
on that thing
what thing?
Looks complex.. I see u tensioning that dude
U yang tension him
No lar. I just write impractical long questions. He just need to tahan and drag 1 mth then hopefully that other guy will forget. How robust is our 7.5%(?forgot what we assumed) increase in Kwh/Sen every 3 yrs assumption vs this 6mthly review in pricing due to ICPT ?. U free to hv TNB sponsored bfast w me at Aloft on Mon?. Their mktg conference. that guy lar cannot i think.
All in all Nirinder assumption is 6% increase every year. . Me on leave. Their calculation seems to make sense. <Media omitted>. This one. . . . . . . 
Wah. That is a lot.. We assumed smaller increase
What is kwttb. . I a bit tak faham his calculation. Year 2 and year 3 Solar rate decrease. While tthat guy increase. I tot solar rate remain at 0.40. . . . . . . 
https://www.tnb.com.my/kumpulan-wang-tenaga-boleh-baharu-kwtbb/. Renewable Fund. I know. Nampaknya complex and that poor guy's model needs to be tweaked
So we don’t kena the kwtbb izzit. . So that’s our savings ?. Ok wor
I also donno. But seems even better than initial proposal. Susah la ni.. I dah pening
Macam tak betul
Ok watt. Ha ha.
Seems like as tthat guy increase we enjoy reducing rate of the solar. . Macam itu of coz better for us
Sounds too good to be true
Hahahahhaha
But if they put in writing...
We are such skeptics. . Prob better I arrange a meeting with joe and then. Them
Ya lor. Sooner the better. Any msgs for Uncle Singh if i see him on Mon
Yes... we wanted to use the 2 % as a basis but decided to have a fixed .... 2 cents reduction... 40 : 38 : 36
remain fixed as assets are deployed.....
Me Msging him. . This is his response. Think they made an error in the calculation la. We won’t be getting 2 cents reduction. Help me toclaridy. . . . . . . 
I memang dah lost. He email me but whatsapp me.. *whatsapp you. He dah confuse who is this Toh Zhe Jing
Sounds like those colo meetings. . Everyone talking about different topics and diffeeent ppl at the same time and all confusion
Ya lor. B.a.U. Business as Usual
Yes... 2019 , 2020 , 2021.... after which we have done the 600 stations... kan...??
ixed... as per graph.... k on 30 th for a clthat guyication meeting...
He thought we are doing 600??
Can they do 600 in 3 yrs?. If credible then why not
I can’t make it on the 30th
What for
He wanna meet but u meeting him on 26th kan
Who
Nirinder. . He said let’s meet on the 30th
oh ya hor. Tak boleh. I meeting that company ppl that day. So do 29th lor. U not free. ?
Me ok for morning 29th
I only free if 9am. 1030 onwards got mtg on Samce bullshit. Approving 2019 plans and shit
Ok let me ask the big guy
Make him come over if not let's do skype?. I think can share screens kan
Yeah asking. . He not technosavvy
Hopefully Dr.Solar is. <Media omitted>. This is a real classic comic book
Omg
Had a reboot in 90s
Wtf
<Media omitted>
How can u remember stuff like that. . U know what that company needs?. QMS audit. They are so fucking luan. Quality Management System audit. . . . . . . 
Oh ok wat. We have See and Gary. Very xp.. There last time that gal dud that thing mar. that guy veli good one
I can’t stand it
that guyk/Kenny: Now vely good oledi. Haiyo u very lucky. Last time SKM/Jacob/When that company started it was much worse
U met them ar
As if to justify that going from F to C mark means no need to aspire to more.
I feel that dude keep thinking in piece meal and not holistically
Intellectual capacity pasal or space/time to think pasal
Unfortunately he is the best amongst the worst. . Digesting your email now. I think he is gonna hv a hear t attack
There ??. Vinesh will come to try pukau that guy. All will be ok. Aiyo. Zhi very theory one. Acruarry ar everything ok mar.
Ahhahaha why are u wasting your Saturday writing long love letters to that dude
So next time when he misses me he can take out from his biskut tin and re read it and re-live the good times. (Tears in his eyes)
that poor fellow May do that
Because that other guy will just write short mails and call for f2f mtg to taruh them kow kow
that other guy write longer emails than that guy. . That’s for sure
But clearly i will be the undisputed champion for some time to come.. <Media omitted>
I think so. . Aren’t u the champion of long emails in your previous team too?
No lar. Who say wan. Lies
Oh so there is someone who writes longer than u??. . Yes.   . Come over for diwali... will introduce our CEO , DS Azman... bring along your boss ...and etc. Abc abc abc
Diwali?. Dah lepas lah ni
It never ends. . They still celebrating
Share w Hadri
I don’t hv chilam’s number
He can decide who to bring but will ask us what is our position. Festival of Lights ma
We shouldn’t go masa negotiation. . Apalah. bawse stayed until 5pm
Ahmad Hadri Haris.vcf (file attached)
For our abc training. . Past 4.30
Har. I declined it
It was suppose to end at 4.30
Oh no i not compliant??????
bawse told us we got conflict of interest
Why?
Coz we so close to that company and that other company. . Global tender next year. Then I told
hv to take over my stuff then. Oh no i bro'ed already
Let her sit in for the monthly meetings
Good idea
bawse laughed. . He said good idea too. I said hv to get BID people to do evaluation lor. He and that madam kept squabbling like little kids. . . . . . . . 
Wah sad i missed it
I told that lady I can’t do this anymore
Wonder if i shld attend nxt week for fun
Working with clowns and doing clowny things in cp. . Actually I tot it was good. Kannan said no contract staff, no delegating this session to your staff. Because business to busy making money for company. No such bullshit. . . . . . . 
And then ask all sort of funny suspicious questions and then end with ... _you know hypothetically or just asking for a friend..._
bID , nadia all there too. . So they took the chance to stab the business. Sham from BID say the line manager always say they overlook. They didn’t know. They delegates. They trust their staff. Sham said that all this goes to cct. Blablabla. Most of them stayed until 5pm. Although they could hv walked off at 4.30 ahhahaha. that guy was worried when we touched on FI payment and payment method. Came and ask me
Dont worry. Cecilia say ok for TK LV. Zhi turns ard w Beef Balls in mouth - huh BCM ????. No funny biz here. Om nom nom
U damn drama
Me?. Why?
This one. . U drama king
I dont actually carry it out kan. But would be damn funny
U are a bit dramatic
Can spread rumor. Zhi ran away bcoz scared secret terbongkar
Ck asked me about BCM masa the abc audit
That us why after Barry secure 3 more years Zhi ciao
I mean the abc training. . He said can we actually pay using FI for that. He is lucky. It is allowed. Then he and that guy asked IDD done kan. . . . . . . 
In Q2 2016!
Not due yet Ma. . Every 3 yrs Ma
IDD 2 yrs?. Oh 3
Yeah. . I had a massive IDD in 2016. Force that guy to do also
Yeah i leave before have to do again
And Karen
Yeaaaah
I am. . Izan. that guy
No lar. Never bang table
We did maybe 60 in 2016. . The words u use. That’s why I laugh sometimes
It's ok. I speak so fast and my engrand so power nobody realise i drama
I noticed. . Hahaha
Ppl say i very british
that other guy also. . Ah??. What ??
humour style. Dry wit
Hmmm
Self deprecating. Straight Face funny. U disagree?!
I am not sure if u are British- funny coz I don’t know that many Brits. . Unless you count watching a lot of funny Brit movies to be able to make that assessment of u
Monty Python. Blackadder
Eg whether u are Simon-pegg funny. . Or hughgrant-funny
Eric Idle John Cleese
What is this. . I know The Full Monty saje
??. Shock.
Apa itu
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python. It was a HUGE british thing !. Ask any brit or ppl who went to UK to study
My husband’s uncle is Brit. . He only watches coronation street. Most boring thing ever. He made us watch it when we were at his place. . . . . . . . 
Omg.yes that too
Hate it
I know the song. I also think it us super dull
My hb wanted to go to Manchester United
But good snapshot of brit lower middle class life
And the uncle forced us to go to his fave first before going to MU. . And he refuse to go into MU. Said he is gonna take a piss for sure at the loi. At the gents. I always found him hilarious coz he is always angry , sharp and witty. I find dutch humour almost same like Brit. . . . . . 
U on leave or working. Still answering emails. I am trying to set time to talk to kenny and that other guy on cost/change control issues w that company at 4pm.
On leave. . Hahahah. Got too many leaves to clear
Oh what coincidence i also hahahaha. Tnb thing is sales talk. Different GM ship under Customer Services so no Nitinder
Hahaha
Maevi is subsidiary of tnb doing similar things to Seido, Saturn Pyro etc
Why is kenny involved
But interesting. I ssk him if got sample processes or flow charts from other mkts. Mkts w a lit of brown field
Ohhh. . He can help ?
Nothing better to do? So u wanna join.. I dunno. Try luck only
When
4pm
Today?. . Nope
Yes
I gotta pickup my kid
ok. Good you got life. If earlier?. 300pm?
Hehehheh. . 3pm ok
U damn free izzit to rebutt that dude
??. . I was eating
Makan him for bfast?
Ahhaha hahahhahahhaha. . I wish I could. I met my buddy yesterday at church who is the cp he met for the RE. She said she wished Vinesh would stop talking. . . . . . . . 
As that dood would say. No need email. Just arrange mtg make tgem take minutes
Problem with that dude is he works on piece meal basis. . Arrange meeting later he cannot absorb
<Media omitted>. Omg brain melting. V boring.
I tot this is your kinda thing. . Numbers charts and such
Hey. 2019 planning. What to assume for % SST in the CAPEX estimates. Planners asking.. We have MYP estimates but these are just historical. Put in 6%?. 0.1. Hi lvl...
6. . Gaga. Hahha. Use 6. . . . . . . . 
Their fees/bonus also 6% yes?
Yes
But they dont claim the 6%. For SST correctM
They charge us. . But it’s not recoverable like gst
<Media omitted>. Correct?
How come got additional line - the 0.36?. . Oh that’s the that company fees
It's 6% on that company's fees
Looks about that
Omg. You macam that dude
Why. . Although
<Media omitted>
Hahaha. . It’s just that. that company fees is 7.2M
Why 7.2m
Your screen shot looks figurative. . It is memang about 7.2
Oh not 6%
Or 6% of the total works. . Something like 6% or less. Thereabouts. If it’s just for estimate u can do it as per screenshot. In reality a lot of the 6% sst is only for consultancy work - pass through to shell , add 6%. Then separately the that company fees , add 6% sst. . . . . . . 
So that company fees assume 6%. Or not?
Assume yes
<Media omitted>. Omg. He is supposedly experienced planner
Got fee ler. . Sigh. Saw your email alr
Wrong ?
Yes good
????. This job memang nonsense
Add me in. . I am online alr
Wah. that dude reply in detail.
Fluffy answer. . I read alr. He tried
So sad. <Media omitted>
Lol. . Only no 4 and no5 he had problem answering. Otherwise he had good counterproposal or justification. I think maybe the whole process at their end needs to be reviewed - the check and balance is not really there.. PO utilisation sent to PM but PM doesn’t do anything wirh it. Then when there MoC they accumulate - until at some point they agak they hv over utilised, there is no deadline to an MoC bevause they cannot predict how much they hv left and how much they need till end of the year. Then u hv those PO threshold that is essentially same as IP overrun . The threshold should not be 50K but rather 5% above IP. And then the approvals are all kinda blurred alr. If I am the PM I receive PO utilisation rate it’s a trigger my IP gonna run out soon, I should alr have my weekly report with the cost and invoicing but it’s not always clean. So I would rely on the Gsap team to be accurate. I should also be able to forecast how much I need and whether there is overrun, at maybe 50% vowd. If there are any funny request, I should be able to deflect or advise properly. If there is a need for more money, I should be able to prepare the MoC quickly within 1 week ( because I would hv all the weekly reports that tracks the site drop/add, survey report cost, misc cost, funny request). When I prepare my MOC regardless of what threshold I write to that dude( cc Procurement) and upon that dude review ( he should check WTF happened) and if all due diligence are in check, then escalate to EPCM MANAGER ( one last justification review ) for you to finally get NDM approval. . . . 
Omg TL:DR
??
This is how that dude feels. When he open my mail
Yes. . Possibly
Was this on purpose
But tough luck. . You mean me?
Yew. Yes
??. . No it wasn’t on purpose
Maybe like that dude brain switch off- too hard
I was trying to imagine what it’s like for the PM. . <Media omitted>

I just thought of name for self invest solar option. Since it's Solar *Photo* voltaic synergised with *Green* Building Elements to create value. Call it Project *Photosynthesis*. To differentiate from *Project Azimuth*. No? Too long. Not cstchy enough?
Lol. . Just call it The Green Elf
Why green elf?
Coz it’s Green. . Photosynthesis sounds so Scientific. We need to be lala. In lalaland. . . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>. Disenchanted. Cannot green. Taboo. Petronas. So photosynthesis

Yes. The sst tax thing seems to be confusing.
Why confusing
that company revised their numbers again. Apparently they forgot to put in for their fees.
??. . What’s up
Some rando bullshit
Come vullshit here la
that company tak tau how to estimate SST and planner challenging that the Multi Year Plan 2019 cost estimates should have already included that company fees and taxes. It's like it's too hard a concept to brain for everyone despite excel guidance yesterday.maybe i just leave it and that other guy can deal w fallout in 2019.
Sigh. . Can’t the planners just check. Don’t fucking understand them. What numbers they using - if it’s that company. . . . . . . . 
They just taking MYP figure directly which is a hi lvl est based on historical and that dude best guess. They say eh got fee? (Ref that dude) ah got SST? If last time got GST then now SST almost same righhht?
Sigh. . Just fuck then kaw kaw. U have nothing to lose. We made the same mistake of doing high level and that dude estimate. Tot they doing area office engagement blablabla. . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>. U saw the mail on Dasvroom kan.. Nominations haywire. 2019 Apple/NGSF also similar. Mich and that weird  lady sending inputs to poor lady look like never copy that poor guy and me. that poor fellow cannit reconcile. But not as messy as Dasvroom. My mental health. I already feddap. Just want to quietly pass next few weeks and minimise interaction w ppl
Lol. . Feddap
I think i sent the fuck u signal to planners already. As i snub their team lunch other day after bullshit 2019 lab session. And i am on leave during the Network Team Away Day on 14th. So rubbish. that weird  lady call me becoz she got some legal fees for stamping of agreements snd she dunno how to justify accruals for opex.. I ask her why call me.. She say not sure who manage the opexm. I say. Your opex then you lar
It’s cath
Cath who?. The modular mtg at 3pm i am going in cold.
Catherine. . Don’t go la. that guy is going
Which shld put me on par w that weird  lady's normal std
I am moderator
Who there
Me that lady that weird  lady that guy nadia
Why that guy?. Modular?. I thought he outstation
Yes. . Modular is his thing wat
Hmmm. Should i turn up for fun.
Sure. . You prob should because they are using your capex. Nadia’s concern was what is the contracting parties, liabilities, why are we using PCA
For 2019 correctM
Why are we using Starbucks drawing. . Do we have an IP alr ?
Nope. that poor guy Sern
I sent u a stupid email. . For u to confirm pca is not a GI vendor. Just help me to support it
Apa GI. Glycemic Index. Galvanised Iron. Government Issue. Can pls send me the email trail for borneo reselling old pump to that company case in 2017
Ok
<Media omitted>. Objective is to finalise 2019 SAMCE design vs. costing
Huh. . Why u don’t need to join
Last time Han happy wamt to bagi Octagon Maju.. I ask nawal got engage that guy?. How you choose/decide?. Looks at Han
poor lady doesn’t engage that guy enough
that company got tender process kan?
This one also poor lady ar
??????
No we hv to ask them. . Madness. Omg
It's ok. Just worried Han got anything to hide or not
I scared. . He prob doesn’t. But he is blur with process. He comes to me for some things. . . . . . . . 
Last time SAMCE 2018 he engage PCA direct nego
Some things he sendiri Jalan
Then that company say eh our fees how
that guy told him to do so because it was opex
Eh permiting how. Hey this cost underestimated only plca msna l3 for relocation of assets etc. I dunno to biar aje. Since i am ciaoing. I dunno if i want to be in an org where that guy invites that dude to talk abt IRO concept to whole world. And he goes up to tslk dunno what cock
What ?
As Malaysis has been planning Mint Hotel so long sampai hotel name pun ubah jadi Nouvelle Hotel
Oh the meeting just now
that guy had a global telecon on IRO/Market Formats eg plaza, trusted local etc
that guy said his laptop faulty
Invited that dude to guest speak
Lol
I am like. Huh. Thank god i am leaving. I feel like my going away gift to ppl will be dunce hats
that guy ajak u yumcha right
And small stool to sit in corner whenever they say stupid things
Lol
<Media omitted>. Yes i snub terus
He ended up in level 3 with me
To finish the low carbon rlc pack.. Good for him
He didn’t feel snubbed. . U too subtle
He too thick
Lol. . Inintro him to your friend. As that guy who caused a lot of grief to Zhi. Lol. Oic u changed the slides. Seems wordy I scared 1 hour not enough. But u are sending as pre-read right. . . . . 
Yes. Only slide as discuss meant to present
Don’t think anyone will reply u
So 2 slides
By 4th
Ah well. No problem i heck care. I did my best
Yeah la. . Eff it
At least i tried
It’s better than my recycled pack
<Media omitted>
Lol
Maybe that guy v free can put in clever comments copy all
He wouldn’t. . He had some comments for the solar paper strategy and he called me. Instead of emailing. He learned alr. . . . . . . . 
Good lor. He is capable of learning.. You share latest copy by nxt Tue, i will put together as part of pre read bundle
Wah cannot. . Strategy paper we hv a boiler plate. Sent via that madam only as Secretary. After Friday - Monday she will send. Remember he had some comments about us engaging adlan’s and low Carbon people and he channeled it to me and didn’t email u. And I told him it’s a good thing he didn’t coz we hv been there done that. Your pack is a lot of info so I don’t think anyone will reply u. . . . . 
Yes. I had trouble deciding what to cut
No u don’t hv to. . More info is better than none and it’s a pre read
I made a how does that company link to low carbon as found many ppl didnt understand
Cecilia made a fuss the other day when Andrew didn’t send any pre read
How that company related to solar story
I learned a lot actually
Who Andrew
Lo. . Lol
Andrew Lol?
Lol. Payment. . Payment guy. Under chia yinn. I saw Cecilia and gave her heads up. She said she is not around on the 7th. . . . . . . 
I dunno. Remember i made slides for Iain and LT
Aikee not around too. . Yes u a real pro and slides. I memang always kena for bad slides
What to do. big bawse not free other days
Never put heart into it
Pretty slude no point
Mine is not pretty at all
You notice i color code and put setem on my slide to differentiate that company Solar vs that power company one
Ehhehehhehehe. . I did see the colours
Just to be clear on difference. But first slide is key slide. The one w all the steer we need. Hope RLC can read. Sorry- makes effort to read pre read
I know that other fellow reads. . Cecilia too. big bawse also. that madam will prob ask me to brief her. ??. . . . . . . 
Ok lor.
She always say Engineering Mumbo jumbo
I saje copy her.
Lucky u did
Why?
Cheng yee apologize to me today. . that madam made a fuss at the lrlt
Why?. The one i pontenged yesterday?
And sent to stern email warning to Cheng yee not to go to me for ppc related issue. . As she is the task force committee and not me. Coz business tends to come to me for everything
Must psssionate mar
Site sticker also kena
Cannot believe wife is Strategy Mgr
Who???. . Whose wife ???
The PPC dude
Sigh. . It’s so petty. Unbelievable
?
From now on I tell everyone to go to that madam. . Then site sticker she told lavonne SzeLin can help u with this mess. Fucking mess because we hv contract with kB colour but retailers hv been buying from various vendors. Told Lavonne this is operational issues and nothing contractual that I can help with. . . . . . . . 
Is KB color still Sharon?
Yes
Omg ppl dont move in this bisness
Lavonne still came to me - looking for me since morning
crazy
I did the tender - and wanted to push them out. . But cost wise they were too cheap
Servsign out alreasy yes?
No they are out
I see Mr.Yee of First sign hanging on
Yes that’s why
And Mark of Good Billion still here
That one no contract
Same jokers
We tried to kick him out
We never explore new ppl ar?
It was impossible. . We did
10+ yrs le. So sad
One vendor fail miserably. . And left. It also comes to a point where we hv got the cheapest. So in cp, we should strengthen some of these relationships. Not all tendering is that doodeficial. Most companies don’t believe in tenders anymore. . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
I intro a few B&C suppliers. . PosAd. He scared of u maybe. It only works if business is committed to hand hold them. And GShock is new vendor. And Ren Events- want to kick Skinny Fat Kids. I intro another vendor Evoke but they fucked up NRC. U will be surprised when we tender , lots of companies don’t want to work with shell. We famous for being indecisive and difficult client. Pay for proton but want bmw car. . 
Change topic. that dude and Sly Cow never reply on 2019 resourcing plan
He is working on it. . He told me last week. Give him time
Or the HSSE CoLo fwrk
This one is inclusive of it. . that dude knows. He is working on it. These kinda things I will just ping him. He is on skype Ma. . . . . . . 
that dude is pushing me to take any capex works involving forecourt hacking from that other company
Tomorrow just harass him
Maybe will give an excuse to meindhart to man up
Hahahhah. . The old man has a point. U keep saying u should listen to him
Essentially everything is taken away from them except for Aircon , chiller replacements, nozzle and hose replacement
Is that guy lar align Mou. . He very blur now. Call me this morning asking about ers again
But I am too tired to have to engage Kantha , Imtiaz and etc
How the billing works although u alr hv it in the pack and we discuss f2f with Shivani remember ?
Now that they are tidying the 2019 work plan.
Why u? Should be that guy lar
that guy lar: Capex ma
So why u need to engage that other company
What billings
Instruct that guy lar that u are pulling it out. . Ers for the 2 pilot site. Project Sunshine
Pasrah kepada illahi
that guy lar still blur. . Told him it’s in the pack Ma. The one u sis. U did. . . . . . . . 
Which pack. Zhi send so many mails
When u decided to email the world. . Ahhaha
I also keliru
Lol. . Lucky I still remember
Zhi v hard to work withm
that guy lar really blur
I dunno what he saying most of the time
One day they willl pull out your pack and then they will remember what u said
He not very clear ar this Zhi.
Wah so wordy still not clear Kah
Yeah.some ppl broken hard disk.
I actually file all your packs
Failure - Cannot Read
Eh. . U mention that poor girl has found a way to increase nfr izzit. That day u mention
?
About some accounting. . In the past was not revenue
Oh no. Touch & Go top up revenue started to be recorded in 2017.
So our carbon intensity is actually lower. . Ahhhh yes
It is pretty significant
Someone will ask I think
Like 20-40% increase
What is the carbon intensity today. . Did the baseline change
You want to read long grandfather story...?
Coz yours is the 2016 approved baseline. . Yes I want
ERS cannot deliver the numbers properly
This one I know
Ok. U asked for it. Just emailed. ERS ask for 30-40k RM but cannot even get right numbers and properly format excel table. Disappointing. But it will be problem in future years as every year need to collate billing for 800 CODO  sites. Hence TNBES / Maevi B
Must use TNB lor. . Yeah
They also maybe cannot.. I asked them. They said errrrr..mm
Huhhhhhhh. . Wtf
I said we can pay for this reporting. Can discuss? They said errrrrrr
Pay also cannot
I dunno. We ask them next week
Ya allah. . I hv a call with their econs fella tomorrow
Yes. Betul tu. Allahuakbar
Asking him why got year 1, 2, 3 SEP rates in a single year !!!. . He gave me some fluffy answer. Nirinder sent him to me
Magiiiicccc
I didn’t include u coz it’s just me trying to understand their econs. . The excel sheet he shared. Which even has TNB payback yrs. OMG. I don’t even know if they realize it or not. Payback in 5.6 yrs I think. . . . . . 
Sounds consistent w our Project Sunshine econs. But our payback was 7 yrs i think
Did u see his excel sheet. . Got so much info inside. Siao. Project Photosynthesis. . . . . . . . 
Who's excel
<Media omitted>. . This one
You ada native
They sent me the excel version
Fwd. We can error check
I tot I did. . Wait
And hopefully exploit it
I did sent to u. . that company actually should hv another tender for Energy Management Solution. Now it’s just pilot this that. It will be good to share your pack to that dude at some point. Maybe he is also confused on the overall strategy. Some parts can omit. . . . . . 
You can share lar. Delete the econs part.. And delete the that power company nego strategy
92.9. . Wow
Yeah that shld be halal oledi
Might make more sense to just increase nfr. . Lol. Than all this engineering shit
The radio station?
Your Carbon intensity
Hot FM?
This gives a slightly more sensible 2017 KPI figure of 92.9 kg CO2/MYR which is lower by 15% than 2016 because even though Power Consumption increased , it has been offset by a higher NFR growth.
Yes. I see you are quoting mr.
Is this after touch and go ??
Me
Yes I am reminding u what u wrote. . Lol. Omylord even asada asking for the figure. Lol. And India and MY didn’t submit hahah. Eh then it became 43.6. Shouldn’t the Steerco pack reflect 43.6?. And not 110.9?. Kan?. . . 
No it's 110. 43.6 salah
Ah?. . Coz of ers numbers
Hence my long mail to ERS. Yes. In reality it will be probably closer to that 93 number
92.9 hitz fm. . Ok. Easy to remember. But it’s alr reported to global at 43.6. Oh u add in the “ adjusted “ slides. 92.9. I am prob the only one who would bother to be honest. Let’s make a bet. If anyone would want to know if u hv 2017 and 2018 carbon intensity. . . 
Apparently important to Asada
And ppl won’t understand why the sites via TNB no need to do that company. . I mean masa Steerco. See anyone bother or not. It’s one of the last item on your slide on photosynthesis. . . . . . . . 
If it was one if planners like that dude he would say eh why not we ask TNB to do that company also ar .. And try to look smart saying it. But did we explore
I think me , u, that guy, hadri know saje
U saw Hadri email. Shit. So much for that guy's caaaaan waaan.
Lol. . I scared now. Think contract need to reword
So funny hor.. Good thing i ciao oledi
Contract says sell electricity la
So?. Is diff from distribute?
Look at hadri’s last nite. . Note
contract between 2 parties should not be selling electricity but some sort of a leasing or energy performance contract. . Our contract is for sale is it not
It is not leasing
I know which means we haram already la
Yeahla. . Haram. Sigh
Dont worry. Just take a black marker pen strike out the word sell replace with the word lease then oh OK. Caaaan wan. We just blame Anna for not checking and advising us properly.
this one is that guy's problem
Spoke to that guy and hadri just now. Will write mail.. In meantime need your help w something quick.. Do u hv a generic ppt of that other company's org and our fmc contract strategy.. What we bagi too loose so cannot claim points as no narrative.
oh. . that other company org chart got i think. FMC contract strategy is global wor. what u need ar. This is for that company. . . . . . . 
Something that highlights how Shell does our petrol station maintenance. Yes
Ohhhhhh. . I am crap at doing ppt. I give u the info. Will dig it somewhere. When u need it. . . . . . . 
Give me raw input I will tidy up
Okay can
Soon. We want to rush submission
I try later after lunch
<Media omitted>. This i will not miss. I chewed her out.. Apparently that weird  lady,that other galand her already discussed.. that weird  lady called poor lady directly and that company said oh ada error we will re do.. So i told her. Ah then?. Clearly this is business critical/urgent enough for us to be talking on Fri night.
This is wai Kee
Yes.
Apa site drawing
Some nonsense where for years we never bill our retailer correctly for rental
Ohhh. . Opt. I know this
Then someone say ah engineering pasal. They can give lauout. *layout
Oh I know this issue. . Hahaha. I actually don’t understand why this is otc issue. Why they taking lead. So odd. Mich came to me about this. How u chewed her? Subtle or blunt ?. . . . . 
I dunno i thought blunt tapi that dude saud my blunt still very diplomatic as i taruh that other company/that company today
that dude is right. . Hahahha
I said this to her as my opening
OHHHHH that guye
And i also really said. Ah then what u want me to do?
LOL
Call them to scold them ke?. As if i will suddenly say oh wait i kaotim for you this weekend. Oh ya i have all the corrected drawings. This little strange elf man came and all it would cost me is my firstborn.
But they all very thick
The drawings?

No not the rumplestiltskin one. But i essentially said. that company oledi know. Write email to me lor. You know i am leaving yes?
So not blunt enough le. . What she said

See I told u. . They very thick skin
I said i am on leave 2 wks in Dec
that other guy is in for a field trip. . And it’s only 3 drawings

Cannot ke wait ?. . And poor lady already know. What’s the point of calling u
Indicative that maybe more may be in error. I know riiight?
So that u wil call poor lady and make her do it. . Today masa abc
There have just been too many of these rando bullshit. From TMs DMs SBO Finance etc
Kannan said some of u all like to call for a meeting on Fridays 5pm
Ah why cannot ar?
Then expect the person to work till night and give it to them Friday itself. . Everyone keep quiet coz so many of them guilty of it
Is it ABC if not shaddap. Oh no one said what i said. Shaddap la botak
Hahahhaha. . Harassment Ma
Go do your AML training and worry abt GO , we trying to make money for Shell
Hahahhahahhaha
Put Hazrul IR there
Siapa itu
The South gangster TM
Ohhhhhhhh. . that weird  lady last night. Ask me and Quintin help her spend 100K. At 5.30pm. . . . . . . . 
ons
6pm mich and that dood start texting me. . Coz that weird  lady ask them to do it that night itself
Good hor.
Mich to do justification for deli2go light pilot 5 sites
Retail toxic
that dood to use opex for prework before IP. . I told that weird  lady. that dood is on leave. And at a funeral. . . . . . . . 
I just had lunch w that guy. He shared a lot of dirt abt his team and Ruz too
It was his uncle’s wedding yesterday. . Funeral and wedding. And I told her he is still in Ipoh. U remember the modular Starbucks. I can’t believe that lady texted that dood. I mean seriously. that dood texted me immediately coz that lady was confusing him about the modular thing. And I told him pls just wait til Monday. U heard that guy screwing that weird  lady right - saying she should sit in the negotiation with Starbucks and not leave it to that dood. . . 
Yes but happily tolerate mediocrity
Then this that weird  lady and Quintin both started calling and texting that dood yesterday to goreng the proposal. . Omg really. I told. He is in Ipoh !!!. . . . . . . . 
And apparently Ruz told Shang to dont try to fix world's problem just do your job and you trying to do these initiatives to get attention ke?
Ah?
Ya. Betul
Sigh. . Ruz is kinda paranoid wan u know
Really arm. *ar
She Macam don’t trust her ppl
I beginning to better appreciate CK
Often cross check with me. . Some of the contracts. Like game of heroes
He may not manage that guy properly but he gave me damn long leash
She said her team don’t update her. . Like how. that other fellow is also kinda strict. He knows some. . . . . . . . 
Exactly! Shang got in trouble because he got recognised in the global network eng call (the rbsam v2 bullshit i did) because Loke or da boss fwded to her. She said haa another thing u did never keep me in loop
I had lunch with the brands team yesterday. . And that IT guy had a lashing out moment with us today about his OR. Yes she is like this. Instead of appraising them. . . . . . . . 
He doesn't micromanage
that madam doesn’t micromanage me saje
Actually maybe he doesnt manage but he has been 1 foot in China all year
She micromanages jess and June. . No le da boss doesn’t
Doesnt wat
Ruzanna time and again says that her team don’t keep her updated. . Sidd and lingesh kena. Sidd for game of heroes. Lingesh for ELA. And I am in the email loop semua. . . . . . . 
She sounds awful to work for.
She is good as individual contributor. . But she just got promoted. So maybe flexing muscles sikit
Ya but now u leader kan
New found power Ma. . Aikee is worse u know. All of them complaining yesterday
Then like that i should get that company to mengampu to me
Masa lunch
I am booking mtg room for them
Today that IT guy just got fedup and smoke with us
Because that other guy on leave
U know he has to go for interview. . Today. Yee kang also
For his own role?
Yes
Wah.
Entire team reapply. . Or not
Sounds like messy shit
Entire reporting line to Ai Kee. . So it’s han choong yee kang. Lavonne. that lady. Chang hwee. . . . . . . 
Again: thank god i am leaving
Chia yinn. . that IT guy. Sabrina
This place is awful. I dunno how u tahan
that IT guy is like u
I not so buff
Well retail cp is good. . Hahaha. He went to aikee and said. If u don’t think my vision is right and I am not the right person then let me know. . . . . . . . 
Wah. Direct.
He felt she didn’t hv to wait for an interview to ask him
Wait am i like that?
Then when Ai Kee ask any last questions. . He said. What is the transition plan for me and for my current role if I am not selected. I need to know the hr process and how would i transition my role. Lol. Oh u don’t know Jem. He is more direct than u. . . . . 
Ai Kee seems defensive and potential politicker. Mire so than that other fellow who does spple polishing but seems like he got vision (never mind he has a few weak minus ones)
that girl swears a lot and he will ask her to wash her mouth with soap
I not direct at all.
I dunno - do the work Baru main politic la
I very english no?
U are sarcastic. . So is that IT guy. He is direct to people who are too thick. Who cannot get sarcasm. He did tell someone off before that if they hv nothing that guye to say just shut up pls. I prefer Cecilia. . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
She is friendly and that guye. . Maybe like u. Me and Cecilia got a mutual friend. So she updates me about her sometimes. Retail is like a broken family. Ok. . . . . . 
To be fair a bit generic
Quite spot on. . Maybe that IT guy is more like bitchy
<Media omitted>. <Media omitted>
What am I then
Canadian?. I dunno. Lets see
I also not sure
Commuthat guyation Style: Canadians are relatively indirect commuthat guyators; they try to avoid creating conflict by taking careful measures to remain polite throughout discussion. This usually involves making hints that vaguely commuthat guyate their message without ‘rocking the boat’. Nevertheless, commuthat guyation is not so indirect that one has to decipher it. Canadians tend to speak clearly enough that their intention and meaning is often apparent through careful word choice. . So not not Canadian...
Find Asian
https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au. U find yourself

that guy came to snoop at what I was doing. . So I told him since u so free. Here let’s go through it together. Spoke to Yong in TNB and I told him eh u know u all accidentally sent me your business case and P and L. He said yah my boss ar..... u  just ignore the other tabs la. I said yeah sure , I will TRY my best to ignore it. Their O&M is 70/kw .... ERS is 255/kW. Pay back years 6. . . . 
Wah.. Talk abt kena swindle. I want to minimise reliance on Adrian from ERS
Itulah
Good job on capitalising on their incompetence
that guy says we should clthat guyy what is part of the maintenance. . But I said it’s moot coz it’s none of our business anyways. I mean TNB
I will hv fun calling global helpline after i leave and anonymously triggering stuff
Since TNB owns it. . Nanti I busy pulak
Eh. that guy too fren w ERS. Then Julie go kacau that other guy
And me. . Omg. No. She ajak me for lunch. I am like ehhh u bid la. . . . . . .

Ohhhhh good one
Do you think Kannan has like a tagline. Kannan from E&C - Do the *right* thing. Kanan no?
His tagline is during the training : u all business to busy making money , ya ya why this IDD so annoying. . Kannan: nobody reads the report, report come out and next thing is Kannan, please advise
Ya lo. China ok ma. Why MY cannot buy this magic kotak
Yes he mention Bingobox. . Said everyone pressure him  eh why , why u so mahfan, this is missed business opportunity. To be honest he told offthat other galand that other fellow on the call. He said I don’t care if it’s missed opportunity. I don’t care if u hv an urgency. . . . . . . 
??
If I gotta peel the onion on this company to find out the ultimate that doodeficial owner I will do it. . He did. They shuddup after that and brought in big bawse
His head got shining reflection and he did gaya pose when he said this?
big bawse said follow the proceeds saje la. . On the call. Follow the process
Process or proceeds. Ha. Freudian slip
And he told offthat other galto not use WhatsApp when she needs to discuss anything with him
Ho ho.. that guy also said whole Retail is wharsapp culture
And he said standard response is always ohhh very hard to get this from the supplier bla bla bla. . I know. I decline a few groups. Chat group. . . . . . . . 
Like Ruz non stop sending nonsense WA and so many grouos
Coz later u don’t know where u sAw and heard what and what’s official and what’s not
Ok ma. FBI CIA can crack your WA acc to extract

Now waiting for Earth project
Good thing no Roaring Flames project. Nanti can summon.. <Media omitted>
Fire Project. . API. I was just talking about this with that girl and that IT guy
Ohhhh API. I srsly thought it was an IT project.. As in Application programming interface
Hahahha. . I just made them up. No project api
Get on it. Ask IT folk to make it happen
Your colo electricity burn should called Project API
Omg. Missed opportunity. Bill api kan?
Colo Hsse Framework. . Project API
Electrical Flash Fire Prevention project
Lol. . Azimuth and photosynthesis. Apa lagi. Piss off with the slipshod shit that dude sent on resourcing plan 2019. And I bcc u in the rfp techthat guyal notes u asked that guy to do , and gave him some notes. . . . . . . 
Bila?. I didnt see
See my response
Oh i see.. Just only.. Yes. Maybe he hopes i just anyhow approve.
Yes
Hmm yeah quite poor. Trying luck or betul dunno how to do. I saw last MoC justifying for more design folk. That one looked ok
Trying his luck with u
Ada more detail. But why. He knows i cannot approve ma
And so many that company ppl do what wor
Solar lor
Wtf la. . I don’t even agree to increment for that dude if he give this kinda email
Aiyo. He work so hard to attach hays report and kelly svcs. Why shell so fussy wan?. Apa lagi Shell mau...?
He is quite bodoh lor. . I used the Kelly and hays before and it shows we overpaying them
But so bodoh that he cannot see how what he send is bodoh. It's special level of bodoh
Did u see the email I sent to that guy. . The one I bcc u
Aiyo very long i susah nak faham
He din forget this homework u gave him. . But never do
Yes he did i think takpe. He jetting off to Beijing tmrw. He help so much locally oledi
Isn’t it wed
Isit?. Oh maybe.
I dunno. . He told me tomorrow he will give me
But he tell Paul that guyhols aiyo i am helping local team. Dunno why Zhi lari but i hv to help this transition. ??speculation
Hehhe. . Kinda shitty to be in global role coz kena justify lamely the existence
Tmrw u want to give that dude a hard time?
In general not just that guy’s role. . Which meeting. The morning Wan ?
Am sure he has fantastic reply for change/ cost mgmt mtg. We monitor harder. Look at this flowchart wooooo. See got pretty color
lol. . Fail la how ar. Am running out of steam but his email tadi ignite my api. We should Call the meeting tomorrow project api. Practise your tulan face tomorrow. I will say standard across PMs with VO no increment. And procurement for lack of cost control and same goes with finance. Only hsse get increment. . . . 
Aiyo but that company project how. How ar how. Must be reasonable...
What they gonna do. . Wag their tail and wait for us to tell them what to do. Why we hv to pay for puppies. They Want to put a PM, can think or not the PM? Pram standard?. Got audacity to ask for 4% increment. . . . . . . 
Last yr got?. Do we hv right on how they do performance mgmt? Eg. If 4% average maybe but i want to see evidence that non performers are not rewarded equally.. Eg. The oh Z say no need to do. Or. Aiyo Z no budget oledi how ar
3 yrs no increment. . Me N that guy defender. Defended. Feels like he is trying his luck with u. Show him so belang tomorrow. . . . . . . 
Maybe he think i let go everything oledi. But so stupid he must know i cannot make strategic decisions anymore. Other day i purposely pull in that other guy on skype bcoz that guy not free for GCF sign off
Then
Cause i tell him nanti ppl invalidate my decision. Must hv someone to witness. So he shld know better
Tomorrow I ask him
I suppose if i stall 1 - 2 wks it will default to that other guy anyway.
Maybe slycow force
Maybe. He hungry for other contract
He won’t get the RE one. . The one they went to Singapore to pitch. For FM for corporate RE. My fren is running the tender. . . . . . . . 
Maybe they show Pram as their star PM. Quality leaders
That’s what that dude said
That fella blur like sotong. Maximum sotong
Pram is Vinesh favourite
Like giant squid. Vinesh is the whale. that dude is blue fin tuna
Still a sly cow. . My fren said he talked nonstop. Syazana one word. that dude one sentence. . . . . . . . 
Ya la. Biasa kan?
She said she kept looking at Vinesh buttons trying to pop out
Like that each time. spouting generic platitudes
Yes
I also can
And didn’t answer my fren’s questions
Safety very important.. Of course quality matters.. We are large org and can leverage our expertise across op units
Oh that’s what he said. . Lol
Like how we wanted to give non performing PM a CPM job
My fren asked eh so hv u done FMC. . He answer pusing pusing muddling epc wirh FMC. My fren asked him again point blank and he said bam leverage on other units blabla. There onwards she said she was disinterested and was reminded what I told her about him. . . . . . . . 
Wah u kejam betul. Ruin that company chances
And then after she just could not wait for it to
Nanti I report u via Global Helpline
So she said she kept quiet and egg on for it to end. . She also leveraging on other cp
Eh. Syazana need to cari makan
Info sharing and comparing notes. . Coz cp is awesome like that. Nothing hopefully escapes us
Who is Vinesh's boss
Brendan right ?. . I just submitted my paper on IT GSS to that madam. And she is like apa itu
Was it a philosophical apa itu. Like what does it all mean. Perhaps a typo- apa I.T. ?
I dunno. . She doesn’t understand the rest of retail except for aikee punya kerja
How. How is this possible. She memang long timer in retail
I dunno. . She is not good with details. Myopic view and just street smart type. But cp kena detail. She can get away with just marketing stuff. . . . . . . 
Ok wat. Itu yang glamour
Yes engineering not glamour enough. . But I cover all lee
Epcm fmc same same ma no?
All except for Paylo. . That one memang only June knows. But she not really on top of who are our vendors and who is doing what. So she cannot advise properly and often derail our strategy intent and why we award contract for certain scope. . . . . . . . 
She cover paylo, you cover ? ?. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%BB%E4%BD%AC
Apa itu. . I read the translation also tak faham. No that madam also doesn’t know Paylo. My meeting with Open Sky went really funny. Their contract ending this month. that guy lar became good guy. He kept saying kalau nak extend contract or retender kena Tanya my cp. My job is to tell them NO. Vendor refuted and said eh I am improving worrrr. And I said we didn’t put up a contract for you for IMPROVING, you suppose to be PERFORMING. IMPROVING and PERFORMING 2 different things. 
Pay lo vs so loh (idiot!)
He fedup after a while talking to me. . And shifted his eyes to only that guy lar. that guy lar was like ehhhh we don’t mean u not doing your jobbbbb. But contract u kena ask SzeLin. . . . . . . . 
Oh the signboard guys
The telco guy. . Open Sky - Sky Sign wirh telco
that guy lar not assertive. Very go w flow. Not sure if under Kenny that guy things better
Yeah la
But Kantha that guy lar pairing teruk
He waste so much time. . I kept telling them no more contract extension. that guy lar will keep derailing go off the trail. I said to them why got documentation work lagi. . . . . . . . 
You step his foot. Under table
That will take 1 year
Or IM him say shaddap la
Contract sudah end. . that guy lar more lembut. Today also when that guy came in
Oh by the way. This morning mtg w TNB - I TOLD YOU SO
Before he fucks things up and make u angry. . Which part. Hehehhe
The excel is fictional numbers
I sent him the thing See put on excel. . We put on the excel
What? Must hv missed it. What excel. What thing
The things we wrote about what to ask TNB. . <Media omitted>. Eh which part was it
The 200 sites is nonsense number
Ohhhh. . Kakakakaka. He din even wanna make us commit to volume. U know he is shareholder of TNB. . . . . . . . 
Funny hor
that power company
Who. Oh isit.
Big Singh. . I check the company info he sent to me. This Azmila also eyeballing me that she didn’t get the email from Nadia on the contracts. I was like - it was sent on 21 Nov , get it from your colleagues la , not my fault u not kept in the loop. . . . . . . . 
Maybe i go work for power sector after Shell. Hadri say i dah belajar all this low carbon energy efficiency stuff a shame that i am leaving
Why not. . Work for big Singh. Like Yong
Yes so i can be working for Aznan
Oh no. . Aznan idiot
Of course ma. GLC. Who am I?
Make that that guy go. . Then u can take his place
He is prob JG5 ewuivalent
Ok what . Whole day churning spreadsheets. . U can always work for a few. Ahhaha. that company. TNB. that other company. that company. . . . . 
Yes become Kantha 2
Fool them fools
And manage the ROMs. Sureeee
Nooo
So inspiring
U just give them spreadsheets saje. . Consulting fees. Charge them fools. Fool them fools. Did u see the email I wrote to that guy. We discussed some of the points before. He also spotted the warranty thing. . . . . 
The solar one chasing him for feedback?
Yeah. . He knows he gotta give it to u
*to that other guy. I am as good as gone le
The Solar Power Guide he gave last time, some guide it was. . Fairly useful, and in summary all countries running on different models and all will differ due to country req and regulation. What the “toooooooooooot”. Am gonna make a snide remark to that guy to update that stupid guide. . . . . . . . 
True what. What they shld do is hv a few preferred archetypes
The Open Sky guys said they can do solar too, I am like sure tell me what u know about it , siapa your client. . U go see la , fucking bullshit
Eh one man bullshit is another's source of fertilising growth
He said ohhh we can do it for u, aka “ cook it up” for me. . The Open Sky Guy was my ex colleague in huawei. So I said yes let me guess , your inverter is from huawei kan
Slycow pull out
Please find out and work on the followings:
ess: Do you have plan to include 'Shell SELECT powered by BingoBox' logo at the monolith? ( still select wor - is it reason enough to put into Monolith?). info we have YTD from those who accessed the BB? ( they never read your pack izzit??? It’s there wattttt). ience increased in his Utility bills? Is he maintaining his shop sales? ( current pilot site is not a good sample since it’s a repeated sku. Else need to weigh out based on a real site where all select sku is in Bingobox then you can see if the sales outweighs the total utilities bill. They should be asking what about the additional cost to maintain the Bingobox like the maintenance cost and payment facility, and not just utility). important SKUs? Now that you already know the peak 'time of the day' and customers' demographic. Please seek Hew's advice. ( they should know that some of the items could not be scanned example condoms. What can Hew say wor.... just leverage on what we have today and not create new sku for Bingobox purpose. We should be riding on the overall CR strategy in terms of adding skus. Else you need to think of new sku which in general people do not like to be seen to purchase like condoms, sanitary pads, birth control , fungal antibiotics ...., more medical related, female hygiene wash). 'Always On' promo to recruit more trialist, have a dedicated POSM with the Promo Code outside (similar to Grab Pay/ Lazada). Could you please explore this with Scientific Retail? ( ini Macam Brands punya theme Always On......this is a good idea actually... but we should wait out for Boost or Wechat ( that IT guy’s Project ), just tap on it )
On another note, this is the kinda bullshit high level questions that came from that other fellow to mich and she ask me to help her.. . I answer like damn tulan coz he din read her pack properly,  then suggest to put new sku, ask for customer data,. Then ask Retailer kalau increase utilities bill how, I am like why ask only utilities , tak tau ke hv to pay maintenance , payment platform bla bla. Why ask only utilities. Bodoh. . . . . . . 
No. Because pack susah nak follow
Then ask Hew advise
Innovation requires new mindsets
Advise mat lan wor
Requires daring
Hew will say go play far far. . We tambah sku based on overall CR la not Bingobox
More than just hardware it's abt leveraging our commercial know how and ppl ware
That why I said unless u add condom, female hygiene wash etc
Not to be confused w people _where_. Yes do new SKUs just for this box. Because why not
I forgot porn. . Should add porn
Jln Tun Razak is bad sample to base future strategy on.. Shop got same shit as the box
My fren actually asked me about it. . Why same shit
All sales figures will not be reliable
Most masuk to buy NAB. . Non alcoholic beverage
No 3 is becoz Eng tak briefing betul. How he know abt mtce fees and all this IT things.
That one I wrote one. . Those in bracket tulan remark is me
Yes i couldnt tell
Lol
I got asked if want to cut short my sabbatical by a HR colleague who just moved to SBO
Sue Lyn ke
Omg. Your network power betul
She is my fren laaa. . U ask her. that lady. She used to call me her go-to-cp. . . . . . . .

Oh sorry. CROWN

She was HR for Upstream NOV. Not my HR as i was P&T but she handled all secondment cases w JVs
I know her for at least 8 years
Dunno. Very secret but some big shit related to data analytics
Wah. . Your thing wor. Must be working for nyon la
Dunno.. Dunno. Maybe not
I would hv faith in sue Lyn. . U know her name is Tho Sue Lyn
Maybe my thing is managing toilets
So close to my name. . My 2nd sis is Toh Su Lin. I was just chatting with her on Friday. Wanted to fish about what’s going on with the 300 roles in sbo. that lady. . . . . . .

Tnsknnccb. . Ohyea. Lol. Next time I am gonna do this. Reschedule for him to fly to kl. And then cancel in the morning. Who is Brett hovland. Why this GC tiba tiba cc him in some squabble between him and April Schering. What is driving the pull for RJ. Service or Price?   Just want to be careful as we have GVR service issues in our markets as well and as we finally get our service stabilized for GFA contracts switching suppliers feels like taking two steps back.. I hate these blanket statements these Global ppl do. Always hear his name but dunno siapa dia. 
He is Sha's boss. Reports to Loke. Global Fuels guru. Like how Paul that guyholls is Global Shop guru. He is big dude macam cowboy.. Long timer here. Was here when i was on Retail in 2004-6. Sorry here=houston
Ohhh. . I dunno why this GC rope him in wanting him to screw April
He is Aprils boss
But he backed April instead
Yeah. They close ranks fast
Like why sleep with dfs for red jacket. . When he alr trying to stabilise gvr. Backfire pulak this GC
GC seems like single minded dum dum
And he cc all of us. . The project team. And also added Brett into our project team emails. Loke is like a professor. Irritated much. . . . . . . 
Who. Me?. Noooo lar. I rileks only

There is a discrepancy between that guy  and that guy on the power output linear warranty
Ooook

Since this is engineering space I should shuddup. . But it’s so blatantly omfuckinggod
Mana ni? I saw mails but ignored
Latest email from that guy . . He gave u the comparison that u wanted. But addressed the email to me
Oh. Ok. Is he expecting me to approve?
Either we be asshole say just follow uncle that guy. . Or say yeah use your tender and test market
Test mkt. Siapa tau
That’s why I don’t want to react. . Leave it to u all to decide. Between u that guy and that other guy
I will abdicate and ignore until ppl call me to ask. U saw that weird  lady's reply. I showed that other guy.he was like ??
Sigh

And teach her
I dunno why she didn’t just go to that poor girl
Opex under Zhi kan. Or is it that guy lar. Or u mean under Cath?
Sp&a tu apa beza dengan opex
Aiyoyo i dah confuse
She fedup alr. . She sent them prompters on what’s left. Few months ago

Deadline on Monday - Friday only they scramble to do the accrual
Need to decide when to intro BCM to him but not sure if that other guy eats beef.. I think poor lady tak suka sama me oledi. Today got mtg (pmc fmc circus) she no say hi

Focus on the complex ones. . With more variables. For the scoping. No need buat semua. . . . . . . . 
Z so high level all thing he say so difficult to follow and not practical.
But all do the big tickets
that other guy ask why i never review how that company resource the team. I said like that might as well sack that dude replace w auto email acct
Siapa buat small tickets. . No time le
Aiyo. It's abt focus and prioritisation
End of the year is better
Dont worry that other guy pro. He will sort that company out
My exboss never allow to just focus on big tickets
He at least is more shocked than that guy who is usually ok oledi wat.
Small tickets sometimes creep on u
Last time even worse haha. Caaan wan
He is ocd like u. . I was his unofficial cp when he was in Indonesia. Coz he couldn’t work with my counterpart. I only feed him info he do all the cp work there. He will. . . . . . .

Cath who?
I did random data consultancy for her shop doctor stuff
Oh. . Cath. I told her to find u. Lol. She is my bfast kaki. . . . . . .

We were talking about this and I said if really need help just walk over to Zhi ka
I hv some shit prepared that will melt planner's brains.
Easier than I share pack etc. . Hahhaha. Jess is going to pengsan. Shop doctor good for marketing ppl. . . . . . . . 
I found public data on geo coord for competitor sites
Wow. . Omg
And overlayed this against 2018 cspex investment. So we can visualise if we are spending not only on good sales sites but those beside competitor sites
I asked that madam if she read your low carbon pack. . She said saw it but tak faham lol
For things like lighting and rvi. It's ok. that other guy will settle
that guy sent me something just now. . From Damansara Jaya site

He is asking for help to review the costing. . My bedtime story. Sigh
See CoLo manyak susah. We dont hv 40 ftes working for us and big budget like Zhi
But that dood very poor thing. . I was with him just now. He trying to craft LOO for DT for Puncak Alam. I can only give him pointers ( use the mcd tech spec )and make a template but hv to make it to our advantage. Feel he kinda lost. . . . . . . 
Dont worry. that weird  lady enable and empower her ppl to achieve to their best.. Coaching for peak performance. Auntie die oledi. Aiyo too bad ah so this sbux thing when u can settle?. And asking questions that make u scratch your head. As analogy it's like : Is 1/7 an even or odd number?
I didn’t know u wrote after the meeting we had with Nadia. . Eh ?
Er....1/7 is a fraction so that question doesnt make sense.
No I mean example ?. . What did she ask u
Eh.i cannot understand all this maths thing so let's keep it simple is it more like even or odd?. And u are shaking your head going wtf
Loooooollllll. . Hahahhahahha
I cannot think of specific eg but am sure got.. Sometimes it's really like this.. Didnt i copy you
LOL so hard right
What is hard
No u din copy me. . I wasn’t in the loop until that dood cried for help with legal
Oh no sorry
It’s ok. . It will somehow come to me. Coz they all clueless
I copied that dood that weird  lady that guy nadia. I was sure i copied u
Only that dood will read
No no no. Fault lies in ourselves. Cannot commuthat guyate clearly.. Making it too complex. Ok ma. Just need to know if even or odd.
Round or square
Why he need to discuss integer vs fractions
Macam Stephen hawking la this Zhi. . Zhiphen
A lot of ppl crave simplicity and a dangerous narrative is one where you oversimplify too far when making complex decisions that are that way because the underlying environment is uncertain , volatile and ambiguous. TLDR: so means u got budget yo fix my pothole?. Why eng so susah wan
We oversimplify sampai miss all the key things and will bite us in the ass somehow some way. . See I simplified your panjang explanation
But then it's ok. Time to play blame game
I am trying to brainwash everyone
And cook up false chronologies and specious defenses
Yeevon was telling me her dasvroom issue. . She agree with me they got internal shit. More drop and swap sites coz of S&O. I hv bfast wth cath and I brainwash her too. . . . . . . . 
Brainwash how
No la the problem not that company it’s your nfr colleague’s. . It’s is a tenacious job that requires diligence
What is
Need to do this inch by inch. . Brainwashing. Eventually everyone will believe it’s true. And soon chant the same song. Go one by one. . . . . . . 
Oh thought it was analogy about being painfully buttfucked by particularly long dildo
Lol
It is at least part true
Yes
But easier to slam externals kan
So just hv to do reinforcement. . Eh tidak. Hv to tell them
Tell who what
Bring them to the logiv. . Logic walk. Depends who I talk to. I spend whole day talking what. . . . . . . . 
I think this may be a prob of describing colour to blind man.
I do my rounds
If logic part of brain dah atrophied
They are not blind - just myopic
From disuse
Then easy to just do data dump. . They would believe faster. Gullible. I played a joke on that dude. . . . . . . . 
Anyway i surrendered.
Since he is such an asshole. . He asked me apa itu abc. Apa itu IDD. I said rm100 every question. I wouldn’t give him the answer until he paid me. . . . . . . 
It's to help you call when u are overseas travelling
I sat next to him. . After 10mins
And a tasty cool malaysian dessert for hot days
He said eh pls la. . I said my son do the data entry Wan. For IDD. U hv to pay my son. School fees expensive now. that guy overheard. He said child labour. Then tried to give blanket statement to that dude how to do IDD for GI. And apa itu GO. I ask that dude that guy tell u alr u don’t hv the link how to do. Made him wait another 10mins. 
Is word before AWAY which is what i'd like u to do
No wor. . I didn’t want him to go away. It was fun. He said I am like kenny. . . . . . . . 
U demented
Always asking for money or coffee. . Sadistic maybe
I offer help freely
What was that word u say
Fuck?
No the word u use to describe people who likes complex stuff. . The one u mentioned about me
Sadomasochists?
Ppl who likes to be tortured with tedious stuff. . Ah yes
Sadomasochism can be defined as the giving or receiving of pleasure from the infliction or reception of pain
But I also like to inflict pain on ppl like that dude. . Saje mainkan him. Sometimes that guy msg me “can talk?”. Suggesting to give me a call. . . . . . . . 
Eh u kejam. Cockcroach just step only no need torture
I will tell him why cannot text. . He said lazy to text. I will say ( and mostly true) I multitasking
Yar. He like to do that when sharing woooly shit
So he will hv to text
And then can say there discuss oledi
U and your friend always say woooly. . Like today
It is a legit term. vague or confused in expression or character
I got people asking for colo contracts templates
China?
I hv it but I don’t want to give to Pakistan and Oman. . China ask me for that coffee co contract. I let them wait
It's ok i heard that other fellow say can can share wan. In a telecon.. I was opposite. His desk
Share that coffee co contract ?
I think so
I shared alr only the sgbp and hsse part
Not sure. Not my business
I sent that weird  lady 10 times rhe cobtract. . And 10times she will ask me for the contract. Until Teh lee ngoh fedup. And call me directly. I did an onboarding pack for her when she took over colo. All the contracts, key extracts , commercials. I think she chuck it away alr. Too busy to read. Too busy to understand. It’s easier to just text SzeLin and ask. 2 weeks ago that dude text me can talk ar, I said me on leave, u can text me. Was the same day I went into the call wirh u on the colo VO hahahaha
So even or odd?
“that lady, just tell me , no need all the panjang cerita”. . All the panjang cerita that lady will tell me so I become witness
Advice for you. You can do and should be doing more.
Do apa wor
Widen your network beyond retail and outside Shell.
Should talk to sue Lyn
Make use of your 5000 linked in contacts
She wanted to catchup with me. . She is my saviour
Is it. Damn funny if it is for same thing and we end up working together again.
U know that happened to me and your friend
No?
She was my client
Kena tangkap for smoking
When she was in lotus
Who was
Me in Sanden for satria
your friend
your friend was my client. . Yes
Ok...and then
When we were both in automotive. . Now in shell we working same floor. When I was in etiqa building with huawei. She was in shell. So I used to go to the shell office and cari her for makan. The building near klcc. Eh do what first. . . . . 
Dunno. What u like and what u good at and what the world needs. Am sure got jobs that fit
I am not really sure what I am good at. . I like money
<Media omitted>
My jap boss used to show me this
<Media omitted>. Where u? 1-4
1 and 2
Are u kidding me. U ipf 1.4
I only feel imbalanced when I see people like GC. . 1.3 la
Omg he is a joke
1.4 is unheard of
I was making a hyperbole
Sometimes that madam when she ask me even or odd question. . And the lpm / that madam equivalent in Singapore. Who keeps hounding me for ev charging rfp
Shell tolerates mediocrity
That lpm didn’t know
Aiya sleep. Bye bye
I went to that lady to complain about her that she is bullying Aisha ( my cp ops colleague ). . Okla. Gnite. I need to finish my bedtime story. . . . . . . . 
that company going to be pretty upset if we suddenly change the goal-post by redefining the C4s 
sorry lor. . say da boss challenge lor. and it's logical lor. they alr untung 2 quarters. . . . . . . . 
Up to u. Am sure that guy will stare cock at us again. And that dude will squirm. When u want to tell them
Tak kisah. . He will call me. Let me send them the file first. Pending that poor girl final data for one site. Unbelievable - I lost my temper with Retail IT folks. Lost my temper wirh that guy also this morning. . . . . . 
Wah. Why lar. W r u. Nak smoking?
Ground. . IT ppl. I din care if he was a 3. Just hantam him. that guy also. Come la. da boss also here - ranted to him. Make sure he know who is the asshole in IT. . . . 
3 whay. Oh jg3. Just remembered i got ??. Omg what set u off?
I got the lcb strategy paper for IT GSS support today - got it supported by RLC . So project call I updated and said we finished even the rfp paper. . Next step is the techthat guyal evaluation sheet which I hv provided and needs to be amended. He the contract holder said they hv their own techthat guyal evaluation for IT and they will do it internally. I was like do u know what is a tender process ,. Even if u need to use your own u need to share and let me review. And that this evaluation will include business retail. He was insistent I didn’t need to know. Wtf. I said send it over to be reviewed. He said ok fine. Coz they will skew it to tailor it for diebold nixdorf to be awarded. Eh ur connect with that other guy for that company series bel send
Series bel send?. Oh your draft. Yes. I will send tmrw morn
Ahhaha. . Not bad , u understand me despite typo
Yes that dood also got funny mail
Apa funny email
<Media omitted>. This is my new fave expression. I wish you a remaining yeae
Lol. . What happened to that dood. I wish you luck for the remaining week. Are they going to reschedule the meeting on the 14th. U not around wor. I mean 13th. I can’t make it too. . . . . 
Wat mtg
Capex. . Emailed them to reschedule alr. <Media omitted>. He didn’t understand when I said use the right symbols for the process flowchart. How ar. I must not be anal. . . . . . 
I slap my forehead too. Good news is that our own guys also so lost they wont understand and just ask u and that other guy back
But that is their own process
So even if it is steaming pile of undecipherable poo it will be fine.. Whatever it is their own PM also lost. Can u imagine See, poor lady, Gary following it?
poor lady can. . See and Gary would be - omg. Prob that poor fellow did it. If u ever put him under your wing, u need to teach him this
Teach him wat?
Proper way to make process flowcharts
How to make simple processes
I cringe - and no offence the colour also damn Indian
Diamond decision, Circle start end node, box for process step.. Easy ma
Yes. . I was in QA so we make control plans all the time
Use pentagon for summoning the dark lord for demothat guy support
Sigh. . da boss must hv thought I hv gone mad. After I ranted to him
<Media omitted>
He said he had to go, oh only because he said he got a 4.30 call. It was 4.28pm
Why u marah my tai kor?. Senior bro that guy
I was “sharing “. . that guy!. U saw his reply. Thanks Sze for reverting. . . . . . . . 
He bz le. Must teach chinese how to IRO
And then he parrot what I wrote. . About clarity on the 3 years installation warranty
that guy std
Then I ping him. . “Why u repeat what I wrote”. Then he said he parrot me. Also I warned him about the meeting on Monday with Nadia. . . . . . . . 
that other guy ask why so much effort on this low CO2 stuff
Coz I said u can’t make it and that other guy not on seat yet so I din want to involve him. . Then he said he wants to dial in. I said no dialling in business with legal. And I said if u plan to not show up , I will not pursue this and throw it back to him and let sleeping dogs lie !. Then he said ok he will come at 1pm. He told me there is news at the global side to drop it. . . . . . 
Good hor. My legacy in dustbin
To drop it next year and focus on plastic. . Omg
What did Z do? Dunno. Pothole oso nvr fix.
Just when I was getting excited with the low carbon thing. . that madam made me do a brief version of your pack. Verbalise what is low carbon , azimuth and photosynthesis. She lost me at azimuth. So I repeat again. that IT guy was very interested. It’s the kinda thing he likes. . . . . 
I suspect nobody understands. Ruzana ask what is this low carbon project engineering nak buat and why it matters. What is the intended that doodefit.
that IT guy does - he is a scientist. . Tree scientist
What scientist is he. No way. Botanist?
Why. . Not sure. But he said layman it’s tree scientist. He likes to spend time looking at trees alone. Why would she ask. . . . . . . 
Fits his profile
Yes . Loner. . And wants to be left alone
big bawse replied on the data capture thing. Ask us to engage Ruz if dealer can help. Suddenly she interested to find out more now
Alamak. . She will say nobody engage her. She dunno anything
I respect that. I too am a v private person
Nobody tells her anything. . Yes he was also told he need to improve in that. He likes to Grabfood. I hv lunch with him outside work and at work too. Outside work he is totally gay. Totally different person. Dress differently. . . . . 
I think we may get along. We hv a few overlapping character traits.
I think so
Eh how u know wan
She told me. . I talk to her Wan Ma. My stakeholder too. I work with aisha to support some of the contracts under Ruzanna. She is a control freak. Yes I think so. Both of u ocd , passionate about things that you both like, cannot stand idiots and would therefore like to be left alone. He is a perfectionist too. He writes very impressive strategies and like u he used to prepare speeches for his exbosses. Did u hear the joke. He had a bad accident - and leena/that girl when to visit him at the hospital. And the father met leena and that girl and asked what does his son do. 
Funny.
The father didn’t know he was working wirh shell
Wah
And didn’t know he was also doing brands stuff
Estranged ke?
Nope. . Not really. He is just private to the max. He told me again last week. Said his father forgot. And that it’s ok because they are like that. U purposely wrote Nothing Better To Do for all participants kah. . . . . 
That is just for you. I fwded ma. I not completely deranged. Partial only. Maybe 60-70% deranged. To write that openly , you are talking >85% at least
Ohhhh
<Media omitted>. This one more tu lan.
Lol
Award for most _ah fukit_ out of office reply
Hero
Wah Chilam gave comprehensive reply.. that guy is probably like neh see told you all actually can waaan.
Still skeptical
Ya lo. Challenge for that other guynn
I bcc u. . My note to nadia. Can’t believe da boss muted the line when that guy spoke
You saw my long luv letter to that guy
I think it went well. . I saw
And that dude's 2 liner.
Hehehhe. . Yes saw. U should do one for Fuels team and colo team. <Media omitted>. Kilasan heights. . . . . . . 
Er....you want me to issue HSSE warning brcoz no helmet?
No
Because u know i so passionate abt the progress and performance of CoLo work?
Ahhahah. . Passion aid
U must imagine me saying this straight faced. No tu lan ness. I feel bad but that dood is damn kacau. Partly becoz he is lost. And that company are bozos
Sigh
But finding it hard to care
He wrote u a long ass email right. . I brief that other guy about the modular rubbish. Before I wrote that email
that other guy is going to hv fun. So much shit to clean. Where to begin. At least i showed him where. that guy just up and left and said ar that dude lo. Dont worry that company will inform yoy
Lol. . that other guy didn’t buy the modular thing. Said he will hv a word with that guy
Maybe he stands better chance at driving the step change i was so desperately trying to make. Not just that company that other company but internally as well
Maybe u kickstarted it
Nah. I've been reflecting on the experience.. My mistake is focusing on systems and on that company when i shld hv been doing more internal awareness/building a coalition. I have the connections in my old days eg if i leveraged Joari to support/drive better internal discipline/behaviors(although i doubt that would be easy) and gain traction via my contacts w old school TMs.
This is kinda true but it takes time. . And need to be thick skin and networking
But the people schtick has never been my thing. Low tolerance for fools
Ahhahahhahha
And cannot pretend
I think that guy was the same. . He masuk lrlt always say things nobody wants to hear. He doesn’t hv frens in retail. Not that many. Hahahah so many others I suppose. . . . . . . 
Butthat other galsaid she liked that i always tried to help and i force ppl to work the process and fix the flaws in process if it was inefficient (vs working around the problem)
Everyone says that about u
Which part
But it’s also them taking advantage of u. . That u try to help. They say it like that. But they like it that they don’t hv to think. . . . . . . . 
Arbinger mar
And let u drive the changes
Leadership as service to others
Omg Syafril always tells me that
Some part of it is true.
Itu pun I got boundary
If u strip the mumbo jumbo away. But Retail ppl lazy to guna brain
I will give ideas but I won’t do it if it’s gonna eat my time and not my job. . <Media omitted>. Do u know we have a DO site with grocery. <Media omitted>. . . . . . . .

Signed la. . Both sites also
Nat found DJ but csnt understand why Connaught woild not be together. Anyway. Worst case that other guy resign new.
Can’t it. . It should be there

Dejavu
No. I went down to meet KB. I handcarried back up.. I am sure i only signed one. So strange.
I tot it was signed by ck
Why wld i separate the two docs
Oh I know why. . Because the submission is only for one site. That’s why the doc is prob with Khim bok. We were only going to submit for one site dulu. Remember ?. . . . . . . 
I know.. But i wld hv kept both agreemts togetherm
He only gave u 1. . That’s why u handcarried only 1

Quick. Your chinese zodiac pls
horse
Ok. Got it
Why
Aiya got u souvenier la. Need to ask summore
Chey. . I tot it’s something to do with the intj thing. Coz I think the zodiac thing doesn’t work either coz me and my twin have different personalities. She is intj. . . . . . . . 
Architect personalities tend to believe that with effort, intelligence and consideration, nothing is impossible, while at the same time they believe that people are too lazy, short-sighted or self-serving to actually achieve those fantastic results
Sounds like u
Anyone who doesn’t have the talent to keep up with Architects’ processes, or worse yet, doesn’t see the point of them, is likely to immediately and permanently lose their respect.. Whole network planning team more or less.
Who is the Architect first. . There is none
Wat is up w Eeyor?. U are more tigger. Your profile pics
lol. . Am depressed. Coz of the fall. Homebound. Work piling up coz need to cover june. And nonsensical work coming from yiboon that I refuted and sent to that lady. that lady said to write to her. Told her it’s getting really nonsensical. I don’t hv time to focus on my real work. It’s like telling z to write an email to me that the vendor is not GI. That kinda nonsensical shit. I dunno why that madam takes so long to send the lcb paper. I freaking draft the email on Monday alr.
U of all ppl deserve a break

RCW?
Retail convention week. . The big ass business planning cascade and retailers convention tu
DKDC. Serves that joker right as no patience to give him the that doodefit of a doubt. Don't know what he did or said but assume it was something illogical and dumb.
that guy also I dunno. . Not impressed
Yes. To be fair though i think he is still learning the ropes but i thought he would take a stronger stance.. In terms of outlining how he wants the team to work
Sigh. . We in for a ride. Stormy one next year
And principles of how he wants interfaces w other parts of org to be managed. It's all ok.
U okla

I was in between the. . Them. Do whatwork? Fb work ar
that dood need learn to be more patient. Even if u know the answer ppl need to catch up to you so they can properly understand and help you implement the solution
Hehehhehe. . That’s what I said to u
He is smart but clearly no patience for dummies
And that guy also
I got more patience apparently...
Yes. . More than that guy
<Media omitted>
Missed opportunity of sometimes dummies can hv a eureka Moment sometimes. . Yes. They all don’t like that guy. But if u were any longer with them. U will know why he and that dood are like this. Zeti is not a that guye person. Lol. . . . .

Hehe
I already hv done a LOT of handover.. If i assess that guy's handover to me was 4/10 , mine to that other guy would be 8/10 at least.
Hehehhe. . Least u didn’t lose contract
I hv no idea wat the mtg tmrw w PCA is abt.. Shld that other guy be in the loop?
He wants to discuss things offline without that company about 2019 plan. . He actually wants to see me. But I am not comfortable to go and see them without business. I hv a planned meeting in jan for u all including that company. He still wanted to see me. . . . . . . 
U know i am leaving right?. After Fri i am essentially switching off. Jan i will be on call only.
??
So tmrw i will be there physically w this Tee dude but will just casually say he will hv to take it up w my successor. _Oh didnt u hear i am leaving Shell_
I do hv something in my magic pocket for Pca. . Dodo nfr
Uniwell monopolise already no?
They not doing a goof job. . I alr align with that poor girl. Are u gonna write something to recap what we agreed this morning. I scared the planners feign ignorance later. . . . . . . . 
I lazy. See how. Goof job?
Lol
ndm only sign off against changes not all the time, we use 2.5% of capex value as trigger, need to update internal slides to match, need to do awareness session for internal stakeholders and 2019 MYP must build in time for that company to survey/quote so cost more accurate.. Anything else?
Wah. . U summarise well
If not that would be my minutes.
So short and crisp. . Sst?
What did we agree again i forgot

Christmas time. So it is the season for miracles
Some miracle like finding out your friend was my client. . Or I join shell with my other best friend together. Mana tau
Siapa ni other bes fren
I was in a headhunter company/ and client was Honeywell. . My best fren Sam I tried to get him a job there , turns out we both got the Shell offer , so we both left our companies and join shell. First day of shell I met this other guy , who was the candidate for Honeywell since sam decline the role. He decline the offer from Honeywell and join Shell with me
Who is this sam. I never tok abt him b4
And Sam was my ex colleague in Sanden
Sam who?
He just left shell 2 months ago. . My fren in shell
The one who did Sharp Ariba?
Nope. . Cp guy. I interviewed him 10 yrs ago to join Sanden as procurement. 10 yrs later I interviewed him again as my replacement when I johere. So - hoping for a miracle. eh. the meeting cancel izzit. . . . .

that's ok. . eh. can u pick up that guy. he's at G. i tengah cleaning up the excel sheet. no need. that dude coming. . . . . 
My best bro a bit down today. Said he felt da boss a bit tough on  them. And summore got LOPC case. He said _there is only so much i can take_. I was upset at fat cow. Saying i was just spouting typical organistional theory - he does that ALL THE TIME.. idiot
Sigh
It was that guy coming from him.. You know that guy tendered today or yesterday
I heard from that dood. . Oh I caught that. I knew u will feel it
Maybe that dude also fed up.. <Media omitted>. This is fucking retarded.. Several that company ppl giving steer to IPM.. that dude, that dude ,that guy  and initially Gary but then now See slso involved.. <Media omitted>. that dude damn funny
Lol. . Wat the hell. How come all the engineers working like females wan. U all should meet my mom. Lol. . . . . . . 
I was going to comment but then wth so many other cooks oledi. This soup over flavoured. My god am i glad to be leaving this job
Yes and it shows. . ??
What shows. The flavorful soup?
That u r glad to leave
Oh no. I am departing with a heavy heart becoz i love this job sooooooo much.
Actually I had an insightful night with ck. . He was quite surprising
The warm friendly people , the excitement , the engaging conversations and rich experiences - so much to miss
Lol
And...dont keep me in suspense. Apa insight?
My first time drinking with him. . He is quite fatherly and honest. Also learnt he quite observant on things. He said to me. that guy is long winded. . . . . . . 
I'm not ?
And he knows the expression when he is about to go on and on. . U are too. But he was saying. What people don’t know is. that guy is the same. Very long winded. . . . . . 
I fail to see how this demonstrates how observant he is.. that guy talks shit sometimes and trues to pass it off as substance. *tries. Crazy thing is ppl actually buy it.
Hehhehe he actually quite smart Wan lei
Smart but lazy
Lol. . Then u?. Smart but too hardworking. Lol. . . . . . . . 
Stupid but hardworking
Ck doesn’t think anyone is as smart as u
Har!?
I claim to be slightly smarter
Wat u mean
Then he said are u sure mou. . He said u r smart la. I mean smarter than others but still not as smart as I. As u. I just realised u spelt that company wrongly - check that dude name that u saved. . . . . . . 
<Media omitted>. Cannot be worse than what i've seen in other emails. Mine heart ada
WhatsApp
Mindhart
So yes. . Your exboss. He gave a lot of good advice
Oh i see i inserted another D
Ehhehehhehehe
Actually i get it wrong everytime
So unlike u
Maybe on purpose
So it just proves u are repelling again it
Meindhardt, meindhart. Told u to leave Retail CP?
Lol. . No we spoke in general
His advice to me is find my true north
He talked about difference between China and Malaysia
China very competitive. Pushy
He said they are hungry
Like India
Hungry to excel
But cannot neh neh talk so much
He said all the gtky are non stop. . And we lack ppl who challenge authority
that guy worries me
U mean worries me. . Why u worried. Hehhehe
TRUE
He is a playboy u know right
Wtf
Chia yinn. . Another 2 more
How much intra-personal shit is going on here
I feel he has not enough depth
I heard Joari arrived at that place fast becoz he has long running affair w another putrajaya lady dealer
Lol. . Lia?
So he happened to be in tge neighbourhoid. Dunno
Lol
But Joari did me a favour. Dunno why but he really selling my name in his circle of DMs
What. . He likes u la. He hates that guy what
that guy said Joari singing praises
It’s no secret
Yes but likely just to contrast vs that guy. I didnt do very much anyway. But i met one of the younger South TMs
He made many ppl unhappy
Jeff Gan- he said he felt a diff as i layan'ed them more, trued best to commuthat guyate work plans timing etc and they felt that company that other company better managed under me.. Impression only maybe
Impression only. . It’s the same bunch. I think they like that u bother to talk to them
Ya lor but halo effect
The quality of work is the same
Exactly
Whether that other company or that company. . It’s coz u layan. They feel that guye
The Quarterly LCSC was such a joke
Disillusioned bunch
Yesterday
that other guy ask if I wanna go next time
Teruk how it was (not) facilitated
Next year. . I need to start learning the techthat guyal stuff
And then it broke down when one if the LCSC commitee did a Nazi style feedback gathering
Lol
If u all think not effective (to all other L3s) u tell me la what u want to change. I want to hear now before we finush this meeting.. Awkward silence
Lol. . U know the crmm thing
Yes.
It was first time for u and that dude
Issit?
Yes. . Only this time that dude is in
Oh. Ok. Not that i care
He brought up some honest stuff lo. . that dude. poor lady
Yeah that dude difficultm
I know poor lady has been crying. . The 2 ladies really. Too much
I know she stressed but i thought she would tell me if she needed help
Odd to go to client
that weird  lady _tsk tsk tsk_
It’s ili
Yeah but i have always said i am here to help
When I was younger
Ili?
I had that problem of harassment by client
Yeah she can be mean
Of coz I would go to my boss and cried la. . Why would I go to the client
Like i imagine during school she was popular bitch queen
I think so
Bullying socially awkward girls
She texted me the other day asking if I wanna join her. . ??
U mean flirty only kan
No he played with them then dump them. . That type la
Played meaning he date date or "played" for real. He married kan?
No
How in world do u know this stuff
Played for real la. . Ppl talk
And Chia Yinn is like little girl lar
Even if I din want to know
Behaviour wise
that dood. . Before he got tipsy. He did a speech about What he thought of me
wah. that dood acts like he is on some american corporate life drama
Harvey specter
Expect him to have monologue to hidden camera ala house of cards style
That’s his role model
So his speech summary...
In summary. . I am his bro and partner in crime. And at very last. He said I am calm, and just get the thing done like an ice skater - poise and dunno what. . . . . . . . 
u steady and long memory. Not easy to tipu/bullshit and hope u forget or dont follow up.
U should meet my twin
But the calm bit is true. You preservere thru the cesspool of poop where others would have long given up
She remembers so much stuff
I flailed my arms and then kena sucked in deeper
Lol. . That’s funny
Like man drowning in quicksand of shit
I want to be like bawse. . that dood did some speech to sapu him
summary?
He just stood there emotionless and then he said thank you. . Some leader he will die for not because of the chair but the person. Rest was all bullshit
It's ok. Everyday before work sly cow must eat bullshit sandwich to power his speech. Maybe two pieces of flimsy facts but insert dollop of poo to fill up the space.. If they win the other job they were bidding for despite your feedback there is no justice in this world.
They won’t. . My fren is more diligent than me. Much more undorgiving type. She is the cp that Kantha was so afraid of. He was her vendor in real estate. The one who said he was dropped as a baby. . . . . . 
Not hard to scare Kantha though. Wonder why Ramesh never jumped up to AROM role. He can do Country Ops. He is long timer summore
I heard quite political. . Even that guy resigned. that other guy and Kenny brought him back
Wah
that other company has their dramas. . Every other vendor also got
omg.i just want to get work done not hear abt interpersonal drama.
Lol
Who banging who
I hear and don’t react lo. . Just know as FYI
I am normally oblivious to most of this shit.. thankfully
Ppl tell me so I just listen. . Everywhere is the same. Eh even cbj is not short of drama ok. U know everyone knows about nyon’s affair. . . . . . . . 
Wtf whaaat?. He married w kids
Your wife’s exboss. . With someone in hr. I still see her occasionally. On some gatherings. . . . . . . . 
In CBJ?
Left shell last year. . There isn’t that many. Anyways I gotta go for my run
Dont cross chains ok
Lol. . Had lunch with Andy Chee yesterday and his parting words was “watch your steps and don’t pokkai”. I left lunch early thinking slycow was gonna be early
Eh how u know him again?. CP?. But he was Miri based. Then in UK
I know everyone what. . Lol. He is getting married
In penang. Too far
<Media omitted>. . How irothat guy - the chain has been taken down
You asked if i could play anything.. <Media omitted>
Wow - most original Xmas greeting ever. . <Media omitted>
I know. I met her on wkd. During ex colleagues xmas open hse. Warned her it would be messy. The org is proud of not sleeping. nature of retail business is we are operational 24/7, and there has never been an hour that Au is not thinking about our operations. I.e FFF Flexible Fast Fanatical. Or Forgetful Frivolous Frazzled. Actually maybe all 6 are true
lol. . I hope she knows what she’s getting herself into. Merry Xmas Zhi to u and your family. Hv a good and may 2018 be the turning point to a better 2019. . . . . . . . 
Merry Christmas to you and your family too.. I hope so too
It will be. . Next Xmas u will be writing to me from some fancy hotel in Maldives
Peew pew pew pa koom pa koom. Happy 2019 and thanks for keeping me sane and grounded

Neh like dis. <Media omitted>
Shoot I should hv made frens
A lot of spam conversation though but occasionally useful news. School hasnt even started

This project includes working across key stakeholders in T&S, S&O, IT etc to ensure site readiness and developing the right commuthat guyations at sites. In this role, he will report to Chia Yinn.. . . . . . .

Sigh. . Why now only say. Idiot retailer
As if my impending exit cannot happen without other exciting shit taking place.. https://medium.com/@malaikat/hack-stesen-minyak-di-malaysia-62d7748a46d6. Image shown is one of the recent GVR sites on TLS450S. Apparently i did not know but while we were bz doing all the IT Security checks for DFS,  GVR Warrantech was happily turning on the IP remote access for ALL the TLS 450s they were installing leaving this back door access for hackers.. FML. Thank god i am leaving.. big bawse is very concerned and I am sure Retail IT will meltdown when they find out.. Dunno who decided it wld be great idea to activate it. that guy or Jimmy. And i was negligent to check myself as i thought soneone in that company would think to say _eh if we are so worried for DFS did u know that GVR...._
Oh my god. . OMG OMG OMG. Did u let that guy know alr
No. that other guy's show. dkdc. I am on leave till Wed
Is he even effective yet

Oh mesti show face. . Your exboss ZZ started alr. I hope she is in for some fun
Yes. Everyday fun. This one is memang retail eng cock up. I dunno if that guy decided to hook these atgs up or we buta went into this. Retail IT not consulted etc
I think he didn’t know. . I am tempted to let him know. But I should just keep quiet
Yes. Not yr biz
that other guy was involved. . This tls450. It’s done that other guy/that guy together. U should focus on your new stuff. Are u coming back as our consultant ??????. Eh that weird  lady and that guy ask if there is a farewell for u. Should I just extend it to them. . . . .

Yes that guy just called me
Mesti pathat guy mode
Yeah lo. Similar to his hand waving of _can one_ during the solar bullshit.. Good news is he is aware as he was working w that other guy to test this feature out.

If i didnt drive any improvements or make a diff
I pity that dude actually. . U guys seems to hv no weekends anymore
Memang like dis average 1 incident every 2-3wks. Takes someone who enjoys punishment to last long
Sounds like me lol. . Feel we don’t spend enough time on root cause analysis / it’s always done for the sake of it. That’s why we keep having repeated issues. Haven’t nipped it in the bud
I am helping my wife out. She has all this year's worth of shipment volumes and supply source and destination info. I mapped it out and animated all the 500 rows of data showing demand/supply size in tonnes and flow lines from supplier to destination filterable by product category, supplier subvendor etc. Intent is to identify optimisations and improve sustainability compliance.. <Media omitted>. I quite pleased as i tricked excel into doing animated directional flow lines by writing a macro to plot dummy points between each pair of supplier-destination.. Now working on using xlsx solver optimisation to figure out what next.
Eh how come u so smart? Did your mother push u to study hard? Or was it a different kind of education system
Cannot tell if sarcasm or earnest response

I hv set myself a new programming stretch target challenge. Create a chatbot using python/tensorflow that will approximate email/chat replies based on the 9 mths worth of email replies i've ever sent here.
Lol. . How does it work
https://adeshpande3.github.io/How-I-Used-Deep-Learning-to-Train-a-Chatbot-to-Talk-Like-Me. Macam ni??. Beats having to investigate water ingress in tank issues every week or mediate the next that other company-that company but he said-she said dispute.
so it'll automate your responses based on the standard questions ppl ask u?. . I thought that dude alr submitted the price submission for DJ and tmn Connaught comparison
There were a few late changes the very last minute when we had to add a few things to get the certification.. Also I want them to tabulate the solar panel cost and I want the actual evidence invoices not only tabulation in case we need it to support  tax submissions
Ok. . I hv a quick question for u. Do u know Singapore setup. What’s Barry , Justin and Xavier. What’s the diff between them. . . . . . . 
I dunno.. No dealings w them. Barry i know from long time ago as he was my line mgr for 1mth plus before i left retail

Self pay. . Who u want to extend it to. Only 6 now. I only invite ppl who asked me and ppl u close with. Like Shaharina and that poor girl. . . . . . .

Paandi then. . Or opposite. Easier. What’s that place called again. Aroma. Self pay maybe less ppl want to go. . . . . . 
Aroma no good. Spice Village?. Or yeah the one opposite fountain ok
Ok then. . Paandi. Okla paandi
Extend to that other guy,  that dude , Kak Ram , Kenny , that guy lar maybe?. Hmmm but then planners and DO fella may feel left outm. Tricky. This is why i wanted to quietly sneak away. <Media omitted>. Some consultant report i apparently signed off for that other company to engage someone to investigate ground settlement and building column cracking.
Ok. . Let’s keep it small. By right there will be another farewell via network
Dunno. Maybe not. Tbh dkdc
Lol. . Is this a trend now in retail. Must take pic of ppl having meeting

Lucas. . Ok. He said hard to remember
<Media omitted>. <Media omitted>. The fuck. poor lady must be tiring herself out
So late. . Yes she is
Writing email at nite
Sounds like me. . Although I am not at the stage where I cry to that madam. I just told that madam just now I am burned out then left with your friend
Wah. Her jaw drop or not
No. . She is unfazed. She herself is burned out
Maybe u can join the new department
Having email war with that guy la
It is called Non CP
Lol. . Blur 9
Since u r already involved in non CP works
Lol. . So ridiculous. Cheng yee is getting better. Less blur. I even got a text from anna yesterday. Asking me if whether I know docusign is allowed only in shell or Malaysia. A lawyer asking me this- seriously wtf. . . . . 
Anna as in ex shell anna?!?!. Wtf
Yes. . Wtf right. When she was our legal she used to ask me about legal clauses. Help her to download. Or find clauses. . . . . . . 
Yes. U feed her sarcastic misinformation.
Nadia was the best seriously. . I work with so many idiots. It’s no longer acceptable
Send her yr schedule of rates.
Lol. . And this while I was having dinner with aichin. The other legal
Reply charged by time spent or no of characters in response.
There was a Paylo appreciation dinner. . Aichin is another character. Do u know her
Not very well.. She is very particular.
Peculiar too
Fussy - gets shit done but very fastidious. But guess maybe it comes w the territory.
I dunno
Yes peculiar too.
I find her very baggy. . Naggy
I never worked w her directly
Me neither but she nags too much
Yes like grouchy auntie
I was quiet at the dinner. . She and that madam went on and on about their kids
But seems to know her stuff
She complains about marketing people endlessly
This is the short pony tail legal person rite?
Yes. . Still brushes her 7yo kid’s teeth. Said she had to leave early so she can brush his teeth
Wait. Pasal apa? that other guy and I just met him on Wed
Not Barry check. . Cheok. Barry koh - Singapore
Oh Barry Koh
Email war
I was barry wrong.
I don’t even know when I need to come in to the rfp for ev charging Singapore alr. . Yes. Barry wrong
Imagine if yr name was Barry Wong. Hello i am barry wong.
There prob is one Barry Wong somewhere. . I hv a fren called Teddy Tan
_Why what did u do?_. Like that dood.
that dood Len?
that dood Len manage Land Bank
I always call him that dood10
Say it in cina accent
Omg I tot I was the only one
Who take care len that dood oh that dood len lor
Lol. . I always call him that dood10. He stopped wearing the green shirt alr. When I said it only reinforce his image as that dood10. . . . . . . . 
He has his magic big green watch
Really. . I didn’t notice
Press then can morph into Quintin.
Omg. . Surely he would want to morph into bawse. How u like his speech for u
I dunno. Forgot oledi. Just remember he said i am a smart but sarcastic guy who likes to get shit done. Ok la. Terharu level 6/10
He asked me why I never say anything
Aiyo what is there left to say
I said I am still your fren - this is not Farewell. . Hehehe. I tot sha was better. Hehehe. . . . . . . . 
But in end no speech mar.. Only 2 ppl
that dude also
that dude dont dare
A bit. . Lol. that guy paid wor
But heavily implied
Not terharu meh
TRUE
Implied apa. . that guy paid with his own money. I went to check
Yeah that was weird. I did say tx
He was honoured u invited him for the farewell
Wtf why
He told me
Really?
Saje want to see if he was gonna use GC. . Gcc. Yes
Wah. He tot i hate his guts?
No le. . He is just honoured that u will invite him. He felt privileged
I think his methods super sloppy but i respect him for his ability to deal with uncertainty and appreciate in some dynamic situations his fast & flexible approach is far superior to mine.
Wah u mean it ar. . He was from construction line. So far less refined. But experienced enough to make certain judgements. And decisions. . . . . . . 
Like that other guy said that guy is super chill and is comfortable working with a lot less granularity which in some scenarios allows him not to get bogged down in the details and ask thr right strategic questions.. Well that other guy was less eloquent. I am paraphrasing
Lol. . U talk fast and that other guy talks slow
But that guy's follow up power is terrible.. Non existent
Lol. . This is quite accurate
He is the type u use for prospecting and initial stages.
He is selective on what he wants to followup
I come in during semi stable statem
I dunno how that other guy is gonna be though. . He ask me to camp at that company office on wed. I said ok lo - I wanna escape from office anyways
But as Han Ern said that guy has no consideration or guilt if he cocks up.
Lol. . It’s only half the truth I think. He did rescue me a few times
He will be oh like dat lor and not even remotely accountable.. Realllly?
Yes. . My first year. I got scolded by that madam few rounds. In front of him. He would take the blame for it. And help me to recover savings. Wong yee onn also. He took the blame for it. . . . 
I also not sure. He is starting to look worriedm
You had no idea . I got it bad from that madam
We may run a bit late closer to 3:30 instead of 3pm
Ok sure. . I m still stuck in church anyways. <Media omitted>
See. Pretty good no?
HAHAHAHAHA. . i'm so impressed. lol. <Media omitted>. i'm grossed out with the "Thanks dear". . . . . . . 
Hmm..... Yes a bit creepy
gross. . i can be his kakak. <Media omitted>
Amusing horrr. Ask it tell u a joke. <Media omitted>. Oh no. I just realised i might hv missed this one.. Do u hv this?
Hmmm. . I dun see it. Don recall seeing da boss approval
Who's Don and why wld he recall ?
My buddy in cbj. . Contractor service desk. He can download the report. i lazy to follow protocol of logging an iqn ticket. So ask don to help. . . . . . . 
It was a pun
Lol. . Thought u asking about that guy. Do u know what happened today. Since u leaving I can tell u. But only keep within this chat. . . . . . 
No what?
All contractors did not get any bonus. . It was announced this morning. And this that weird  lady. Omg. . . . . . . . 
Why?
that lady asked her. . And she said “ ohyea I need to update u, no Bonus this year “. And she said it in front of that lady and that dood
wtf top marks for people skills
At least Hew pulled kye aside and inform him. . About 4 ish. that lady went to a room and cried. I went to see her. . . . . . . . 
But why? Bad yr for Retail?
No, not really
I tot our C5 super
I mean it was really bad crying type. . Kye also there. Mich too. We all tried to console her. . . . . . . . 
Wait shld i hv informed that dude!?
I just told her to move on. . that dude is ok. He is STC. These are contract staff. . . . . . . . 
Oh IQN ppl
Kye that lady. . A few of them. They don’t earn much. And kinda hoping for the bonus. . . . . . . . 
Work like donkey
Yeah. . She was inconsolable. She asked that weird  lady
Oh dear. So how. She throw letter b4 that weird  lady go on leave
that weird  lady just say big bawse decision. . Not so easy. Need to find job la wei. She got 2 kids
She does!?!
Yes
I didnt know
8 and 12
I thought she was married no kids. 12!
Yeah
Wah
I m very close to her. . I couldn’t help but cry too
So how. Oh no.
Nothing can be done. . She has to move on. Kye does tobacco. I don’t think they hv intent to keep him. So management also heck care. that lady’s scope also dwindling. The other contractors haven’t had a full year working so they don’t feel the impact. . . . . 
Well that weird  lady is not the most inspirational leader. So not sure how she keeps them motivated
She isn’t. . But at least know that such news should be told in private lo
She delegated a bunch of Mc D shit to that dood and said bye i am going on leave...
Yes they are all used to it. . Even when she is around she delegates to them what. No difference
<Media omitted>
Lol
How. Drwg dah bagi. Dunno why PCA go do dwg w option 1 and 2
What will need to happen
Sorry Octagon Maju
Resubmit drawing
Dunno. Tear out door. Knock down new lubang.
Or change door. . Lol. Saw that poor girl just now
How. Could this go wrong. BCM gave a drwg with door location. OM did their own one and put in 2 options?!?!
She said u still very busy
Who
that poor girl
I am?
U aren’t ?
Typo.. I am.. Or I am!
Lol
Ayam!. ??
We camping at that company office tomorrow
I know. I am turning up for lunch.
Oh. . Good
Even my bye bye lunch that dude nvr send invite
Then who sent. . U call us when u get there
Maybe he thinks i rather not see their collective faces. Not far from the truth
Really. . Then why u coming. Yeah that poor girl told me your kids hate her lol
Propriety and respect. Decorum
Maybe u will miss this. . Who knows
Hah. Dont make me laugh
U will miss all the nonsense
No i will not.
Things that make u laugh and excited
I've intensely disliked this since first mth.. To be honest i've failed to change anything either.. Even as i leave it is as if i never came in.. No improvements or major changes.. that other guy has right idea - re- baseline that company's KPIs.. I wanted to do so too but got badly distracted amd then eh !?!? 6mths past already le
Can’t say u did nothing la
What did i do?. Interface internally still cacat.
Keep them on their toes. . Fix the ip governance
that company resource and capability just as bad. IP governance fixed. Are you delirious?. Mana ada
Try to fix
What did i deliver?
Surface all the problems
NTIs delayed
that company. . lol
CoLo projecrs delayed. that company not much work what. Just doing what that guy already planned. This is the impression. Nonsense.
The savings is really high 2018. . U piloted wireless atg. Settled the Turnkey rubbish
Itu semua ipf 0.9 basic meet expectations saje.. Artificial
Where got
that dood did most of heavy lifting
I cut a lot of savings
I was just the bureaucratic cop. Good cop bureaucratic cop routine.
Still was something. . People appreciate your coaching u may not realise it. Q
Q?. Coaching not equal to results or performance. I allowed the that other company thing to fester.. Shld hv cut it off. Not sure if i inspired any that company ppl or developed their talent.. that poor fellow not counted.
That’s a hard one to crack
Apa Q
Typo
In hindsight. I shld hv more actively _directed_ that company and l3 community (I.e the running joke that is the LCSC )- i left far too much in that dude's hand hoping that the flexibility and non prescriptiveness would allow him to develop his own solutions. I should properly have also spend more time with that guy directly and not bothered doing the whole that company bullshit which was an immense timesuck for no return/that doodefit.. Probably not properly.. Stupid google voice dictatiom
Your wife did a good job making u do reflection. . Your lack of direction could stem from lack of leadership on da boss side
As much as i think that dude cannot manage i am thankful i am not managing Kantha. True but we need to be our own inspiration
Not everyone is self motivated
U cant blame that madam if u cannot perform
I don’t coz I perform ??
I also failed in my internal team mgmt. that dude and Ramlah now become that other guy's problem.
Your tenure too short to fix people problem
Difficult to see what it is that  i actually did that was biz impactful,  would drive long term structural improvements or even more mundanely inspiring  leadership / coaching / ppl development perspective.. Maybe it's not the role that is bullshit but maybe i am the ??. <Media omitted>. Nah. It's the job
I think u would need 2 yrs at least to see something
Anyway it's all going to be just interesting history soon
Yes. . Should map your next chapter. As house husband
Learning opportunity to self reflect. Well the HR lady doing hard sell to me.. Hv u heard of Sales Force?
Yes of coz. . My friend used to work there. I ask them to bid for something before
In Shell i mean
Yes I hv heard of them. . They do our tickets for askcp last time
Global commercial uses their platform
The system
You've got a whole platform that is offered as a cloud service. They've*. Google cannot understand my my accent
Lol. . So u gonna work for them ?. Is it sue Lyn?. Or another hr?. . . . . . . . 
Anyway there is a JG3 job Commercial Productivity Excellence Mgr. Wee Kee's wife.. Hannah from CBJ. Not Sue Lyn
Oh I don’t know Hannah
It's a Data Analytics job for CRM but the problem is it sounds a lot like a Salesforce system admin/ techthat guyian/back office focal. Interfaces will be with the commercial sales 1st organisation and Salesforce and whole bunch of indians. Doing report, KPIs but also supposedly insights from customer sales data. Apparently she spoke to the GM after I had my gtky with him. Told me the job might be virtual so i could even be Singapore based. I.e no need come back to cyber. I dunno. Totally new environ and tbh sounds like Senior SAP Analyst job to me rather than true analytics... partly because the GM was Salesforce this, Salesforce that.
Who is wee Kee. . They apparently are quite good. Very data analytics stuff. Did our ticketing system which was so much improved - before they took away askcp and move it to krakow. . . . . . . . 
I know they have a very active external community but can't help but feel that it is very locked it because everything is on their platform i e it's a subscription basis so you can really code your own stuff. *locked in
U know what happened today. . I was supposed to do the commercial powerhouse submission (cp) for trip to Sydney. I thought I was only suppose to do 1. Dilly dally on that 1. Submitted and the organiser said wrong format. I resubmitted. And then that lady said I am supposed to do 2. Omfg. And it would hv been ok if I had to goreng it but it requires Business Feedback. So I was harassing that other fellow just now. I only started working on the 2nd one at 6pm. 
Wah.. Did u pull it off?
Just did. . Today was the deadline
Success.
that other fellow was like when u need it. . I said today - it was 7.30pm
Running Retail w JIT planning
I really hate doing all this write ups. . that lady can always tell if I invested time in what I do
U blur or someone forgot to tell u properly
I blur. . And I really hate doing all this shit stuff
waaaat?!
Hv to get business feedback. . Write a story
I didnt think possible
Put up some numbers. . I blur coz I din care about it. that lady was kinda like wtf. She said she fought for the 2 nomination for me. So I said ok lor, give me till end of today. that other fellow wanted to add so much stuff into it. . . . . . 
Does it super motivate u ?. Wait what nomination?
I just didn’t want to disappoint her. . The commercial powerhouse competition to go to Sydney. So they compile all the best stories from last year. Pick and choose. Then nominate. . . . . . . 
Oh. I see.
It’s a cp competition under Fabian
Mr Ziggy
So it’s the entire cp globally. . And I got 2 nominations
Getting zieggy with it
And so I hv to do another stupid write up just for the nomination. . Omfg. I hv been stalling it for 2 months
Poor u. So good that u hv work to write abt how good u are.
I know. . Shell is so fucked up. There was once that madam asked me to submit success story for cp newsletter. I gave her 2 and she asked for a different format. Then I said like that I don’t want to submit. No tq. . . . . . . 
Dont worry. Your career is abt opening doors. Mine is currently abt relocating wrongly installed ones.
Lol. . I hope so. My salary alr above ceiling
Time to move JG.
Sigh. . Out of luck maybe
Go upstream teach them how to buy milk properly.
??
Drilling fluid like milk ma
I still haven’t resolved the milk problem. . Retail problems are really jialat
Yes. No need to explain to me
Milk is like a 2 yr problem for me. . Like wtf
I am tempted to no show tmrw's lunch w that company team but guess that wld be _very not that guye._. Maybe i send shell bot instead
Lol. . Can u make me a robot to do ariba. And writeups and slidepacks
slidepack maker got oledi ma. Just need to re do upstream one to retail
Got meh
Didnt i share w that poor guy and yrself. It makes slide pack w titles, generic text and charts
Lol
Got inspirational posters too. Randomly generated
Cp slides are so boring
U dont remember?
I can only do boring. . I remember
See. I just need to reprogram the bullshit generator words.
Bullshitbot
Replace wells w customer, subsea w IRO , offshore w site hero. Maybe i will do that before i ciao.. And put some stock images of retail sites, customers, etc
U r ciaoing on Friday right
Yes that is the plan but maybe need to still retwin laptop.. retain. Until 31st. Nobody has SAP access
Omg
We had to go to big bawse
I heard
For PR release
That is crazy. . that guy should hv a higher threshold
I had to approve that guy's access. So weird hor?
Wtf. . Then Ramlah must hv made a wrong request. She said she tried to map that guy to ck’s
Because others Au, Ruz, that madam out so fastest was me.
Something is wrong
And that guy has case of convenient amnesia and invisibility nowm
So that other guy has no access either ?
Nope. In process.
Iqn thing also waiting for that other guy
So i need laptop so i can tekan butang
My fren Don alr did his part. . How the hell did that guy transition to u. System wise ?
Messily
Lol
similar. But that time got CK, that guy mar. that other guy may hv trouble cause so many movements and new ppl.
What about that company TPA access
Shivani too
Is it mapped to that other guy yet
Get this. It took >6mths get them to remap from that guy to me so by late Oct when i knew i was ciaoing i told that guy u hold onto this.. There is a mail of IT talking to IDP IT on how to do it.. I find then i fwd.. Damn funny.. Like watching 2 bots talk. Helpdesk battle - Round 1 - Fight!. All the while i was copied as distr list grew and grew
Omg. . It took me a while to map the TPA access. That time the IT support was crap so I did it for that guy. I was his IT support desk. . . . . . . . 
I fwded the crap to u for yr amusement.
Omilord. . Sounds so familiar. Lol. Although I used to deal with the cbj team. So I just walk over or Ping the people I know. . . . . . . 
dkdc but yes that other guy will need yr help.. that guy still has the formal system role.
Omg. . This is so amusing
I told him i too tired to fight/explain pls hold on to it and pass straight to Navim
I really snapped doing this TPA thing last time for that guy. . Coz after fixing the issue for him. that other guy who was the engineering support at that tome. Told me he has an IT focal that I could hv used. ??????????. But in the end my friend who helped me was far more resourceful to get it fixed. . . . . . 
I honestly dunno if they changed it or not in the end.... I hv it for Ramlah only. Not that company team
Omg
YouGov survey: British sarcasm 'lost on Americans' - BBC News. ws/world-us-canada-46846467. Thought of that dood's comment abt me.
do u remember what happeend to the partial rewiring. . are we waiting for action from imtiaz to clean up the list
Er...check with that dude. Or maybe that guy lar.
ok
I think action was on that guy lar
yeahlo
To go back to that other company w what that company found at the 2-3 sites.. And get them go repltly
yeah. . that's what that dude said
I was in room w him. Tbh i didnt chase that guy lar. I guess he has been distracted by other things.. that dude, that dude, myself and that guy lar
okie no worries
<Media omitted>. I need yr advice on something.. that madam sprang a last min surprise on me. In nutshell she wants me to defer my sabbatical by another 3-4mths and get me to become internal "org effectivenesd" consultant to  frame the issues, align stakeholders and design phased improvement plan along with all the data gathering, interviews, analysis, synthesis and facilitation of necessary key forums / workshops etc to make this happen.
Do it la. . But
It will be time based so i will develop the Terms of Ref and workplan proposal w her and she will slso look for someone to carry it onwards
Prepare yourself for nonsense
I KNOW. Right?
Can’t u do other things first. . Feel it’s too soon. I think
I dunno if i cannot fix Eng what hope do i have w everything else
U need a longer time out. . If i were u. Come back 6-7 months. Later. . . . . . . . 
I am gone by then.
Too soon
As in Singapore gone
Things won’t change much. . U may as well wait
I told her optics/impression mgmt important as i hv been so cryptic abt why i am ciaoing. And then suddenly i reappeae
Negotiate for 6months later
And can be seen as Upstream think they so pandai ar. As ppl know i worked w her and Datuk. Cannot resolve my toilet door/pothole/tank summore want to teach me how yo improve
Ahhahaha. . Lol. But. It’s a good offer. . . . . . . . 
I know. Consultancy. Pure consultancy w out hvg to deliver. Develop plan
Think about yourself first
I dunno. I am ready to do other things oledi.. This one feels like a long goodbye.. But that madam said it would be focussed, short and wouldnt i want to close out the story differently?. she still needs to work all the org support and buy in from big bawse and other LT members but she asked if i nak ke tak?. She cannot think of more suited candidate as i was also involved in the big restructuring in 2015, i worked w her directly in NOV team alignment/direction setting for first 1-2mths in 2016, i know the issues and ppl here, i know the resources in wider Shell for Org Eff and CI and etc.. She wanrs my brain power and if i want i can get Jenni or someone else to _be the face_. (I dont quite know how that work though...)
I don’t think u can take it. . Ahhaha. It’s too soon
I know. I am doubting myself too.
I am doubting u too ahhahha. . It’s seriously gonna sip your energy
To soon for me or the org ?
Too soon for u. . And people not receptive to change
That one memanglah whether now or 6mths later. She wants now bcoz she's fresh in and ties into RCW and some otger T&R Granular Planning nonsense.. But it's a relief to hear she recognises that it's super messy and unclear how things work in the biz. At least i know it wasnt just me.
But. . The rest are oblivious. U hv to advocate the change. U up for it ar. . . . . . . . 
I dunno. I am thinking of dummies like that guy, that dude who are wilfully lazy/unaccountable , dummies who are well meaning but blur like fuck like Chang Hwee/that guy lar/that weird  lady or ppl who do well in their own fixed scope but hv no clear strategic direction from leadership (probably the NFR Supply Chain folk, maybe that dude ).... ...but on the other hand i also think of ppl like you, Shivani , that IT guy who are basically rewarded for good work with more work (i.e non CP audit :p ) and effectively enabling the dysfunctional non performance of others. So it might be worthwhile if I can help develop/start something that can eventually drive a change to help you guys and improve the biz as a whole. I just need to as Mineheart says B+. Cause i can conceptualize it and put a narrative to it (and look for right biz impact numbers to build credible evidence abt what's broken ( _neh the pothole la_ ) and why it matters) so that is already half the journey as this gig is a short term "consultancy" thing. So i just need to psyche myself up and zen against the nonsense bcoz no matter what i am still leaving.
Too soon. . That’s my take. They need to let you breathe
I is not mentally strong. Clearly i recognise this. So I would build a short term task force and enlist a few ppl. 20% of their time to hopefully in future free up the 80% spent doing non value adding (and on top of this - other ppl's) bullshit
Spend some time alone first. . Recalibrate yourself
I hv a few weeks can reappear after CNY dong chang dong chang
Next week?. . Lunch with your friend. I just think that unless the lrlt is accountable and be vested in the whole thing, it won’t work, because they are the idiots chasing for targets and not addressing structural issues. Those down lines are incompetent because of incompetent leaders too.. I have seen people come in as consultants trying to make a difference but you will end up getting brushed off and ridiculed. Of coz better you than anyone else . But nobody will be thinking for you. I would focus on mental health first if I were you. Even now as the epcm manager not everyone listens to you. I think only a fraction of people with a mix of jg who appreciates your advise. . . . . . . . 
Isnt this depressing though?
It’s the way it is . Try telling that other fellow and joari. . We were even lucky they would even follow the cp processes. Even ethics and compliance they don’t give a hoot about. But it’s a long journey right - so it cannot be a 6 months project. To fix things you almost need to now work on 2020 myp ahahahhahha and See your fruits of labour in Q1 2021 lol. Just the MYP including planning and delivery is good enough to see what is wrong and what needs fixing. I wouldn’t try to do more -. . . . . 
The biggest blocker may be the ringmaster himself
U know I have a QMS background. . TS16949. So I always end up doing some CI or process thing. The roadblocker is Always the boss. . . . . . . . 
Do u know Tessie has a Msc in Statistical Analysis or Actuarial something
Ahhahahah seriously????. . But I never worked wirh her. So yesterday after u left. I scolded that guy and made him do the 2 pilot site calculation. Afternoon I scolded Syafril for some ariba process I wrote to that lady. Unless someone can be continously striving to improve. Nobody is gonna give a damn. I wrote and embedded attachments of inefficiency in Ariba to that lady. Coz that madam won’t give a damn. So if u take this role u need to think about who in retail is gonna be your advocates. Mid management honestly I cannot think of anyone. that IT guy , that other guy,
That is just sas. Sas
I scolded mich , why u take this LMA
Sad
U not contact holder. . I scolded that guy. Do it now. He sat next to me and I told him pull this the this data. Like a teacher. that other guy was laughing. I told that other guy in front of that guy this fella can do paperwork - he just lazy. Over lunch that guy told everyone he kena scolding from me. At night we had drinks and that dood was joking that I was that dood work wife. bawse asked if I have divorced that guy yet. . 
You are enabling the dysfunction.
How. . I could hv left it alone and did it for that guy , isn’t that enabling the dysfunction more ?
No. Strategically allow some failures so they can learn or to make the inefficiencies visible
Some. . There are some I biar
Important skill for line mgmt. Cannot micro manage everything
But I hv a habit of pointing things out. . Else I feel I am not doing my part of intervention
U single handedly carrying a big part of org's stupidity
Whether they listen or not
Not carrying but supporting i mean. Point out but dont dictate answer
Eg yesterday
Just realised that is what i tried w that company
that other fellow and that lady talked about our tender. . To overtake the level 27 deli@work
that other guy is going full on teach them how to do it
that other fellow and that madam said oh very simple - just take them out. . They really caught me in a bad mood
Take them out?
I told that other fellow u are oversimplifying things. . We want to replace them with our own operator
Ok mar. Why kenot?
Supposed to be confidential project. . And I told them - please talk to corporate RE
This is the boldness and vision necessary for innovation i.e bingo box
Understand the leasing agreement. . And which ones are our assets. They were like who is corporate RE. Really &£;&&;@:@:@!!!!. . . . . . . . 
I tell u this for sure is that other fellow's internal view if himself
Perhaps but we hv done enough to make him listen to cp. . He is bit wary of our process and always advocate the transparency. And has been the only one who uses Ariba actually
Like budak sekolah must be nagged into submission and kena rotan if non compliant.
Yes. . It’s literally like that. U think as consultant u won’t hv to do that ar
Of course but i dont hv to follow all the way thru.. And key is top lvl buy in
Think u need a breather from retail
Meaning if ppl are blocking then there is escalatiom
Zahrin should influence the LT now
And big bawse wont say biar lah tu we got bigger fish to fry
U hv no allies. . Nobody is interested to improve
U not my ally?
I am non retail
Sniff sniff
Not in the business. . People can dismiss me
U r better u r Non-Retail
Ahhahah
Like Non CP Audit
I look at that lady. . Working with her this week was just painful
Future Head Of Planning prob
Me and yen did the project brief for her. . I did the rfp. All she had to do was just present to the vendors
But still will probably do better than that guy
I am not sure. . She is ... the word is “dense”. Bimbo. Can’t stand it. At one point during project brief for one of the vendors ( we had back to back 6 sessions) she was not around and onlh that other fellow, and he said SzeLin why don’t u do the project brief to the vendor .......... Wtf. I sold the idea better than that lady did.... at least I don’t speak in broken English !!!!. . . . . 
True. I had a conversation w Chang Hwee and that lady that was so stupid that i began to question that maybe i began to doubt myself eh maybe i dont understand it myself
Lol. . I almost fooled myself into selling the project to the vendors. I was really angry when u left after the solar meeting
Why?. Me?
I open the  spreadsheet that guy sent and show it to him. . I asked him where is the formula. Where is ers data. Where did u put it. He gave me everything and expect me to compute it. I didn’t even need to teach him honestly , he just sat there and worked on the spreadsheet on my laptop on his own while I pointed out where and what. Then we had to go for lunch and I continued grumbling. In his car. . . . 
This is terrible.
Which part is terrible. . Not used to this one liner Zhi. Elaborate pls
I thought u work so long in retail u wld be used to brief but cryptic & ambiguous pronouncements
No lo. . I normally need to know in detail. Not as detailed say. As u. . . . . . . . 
Terrible as in that guy is behaving  like a child and not a mature adult
I did say sorry after that. . I treated him like a child
Why are you apologising to him.
I was a bit over the line
If dowan to be treated like that dont behave like a child
Lol. . He wasn’t angry
Even that poor guy who is overwhelmed sometimes will say ok i take it from here and try to commit a date to give completed productm. Instead of ah can u sit wit me and do it step by step. Because i know how to do but too lazy to think. And cannot use excel properly
Yes why don’t ppl do that anymore. . Dunno just say dunno. Sorry accidentally called. Doing mom duties. . . . . . . . 
Becoz jatuh maruah
Problem with that guy is that he knows how to do it. . He just lazy
So let's review. Ppl in retail are. a) competent but lazy. b) well meaning but limited capacity. c) lazy, incompetent but somehow magically protected due to politiking bagus or line mgr also too lost to know what to do
I don’t hv so many categories. . Only lazy and incompetent
d) competent but overworked becoz trying to help the a,b,c ppl
Too many la your categories and too complicated laaaas. . Eh how would you categorise me. Tell me - under apa bucket. And I wonder who is in the same category as me. . . . . . . . 
(d)
But I don’t feel overworked. . It’s only sporadic
maybe your pain receptors dah cacat
And at times doing things that I don’t like that I would voice out anyways. . Omg. Lol. Who is in my category. . . . . . . . 
Like in fire injury after 3rd degree burns the skin and nerves also terhangus oledi
Or I am so infused with alcohol I am numb and. . Alr. Who. Eh u lo. . . . . . . . 
(b). If i am fair in my assessment
I am kinda close to that poor girl. I put her in d. . She is really good and she often goes to me to bounce ideas but all she needed was assurance and affirmation. She doesn’t really need me. But lack of guidance from anyone
Well the way the biz carries on the org will eventually be full of mid lvl mgmt that guy lars and that ladys managing that weird  ladys and Chang Hwees  led by directionless next lvl up that guys
Hahaha that’s a scary though. . Thought. What makes u think it’s not alr like
I bet that dood will be passed over for that lady
He got good global support
Or maybe Melayu kuota dah met becoz that guy there
Randy and mike. . But not that guy I feel. He not good with working under  authority
Yes dear
Lol. . He told me about his interview. Briefly. I didn’t want to know more really. Either way , none of them are qualified. . . . . . . 
Them=?. that guy lar as new that guy. Scary hor
Impatient that dood, dense that dude, Princess that lady, indecisive that guy lar, creepy GC. . that guy lar just needs to improve his decision making skills
that dood most competent but most abrasive
Otherwise he has the right experience
He is no leader
that guy lar?
that guy lar
Improve alr
Not the most inspirational
The other day he screw the formats team and deli2go team
But then again he is managing Kantha
Setting the right expectation of what is that other company scope for nfr
Oh good.
He said he got “other more flammable things to worry about than your oven “. . Lol. Improve alr. U spend some time talking to that guy lar he makes sense. He just lacks confidence. . . . . . . 
U realise unless minuted nfr team will forget and msg will be badly garbled when reaches TMs snd Retailers
But he has the right attitude. . that other fellow ask me to minute our conversation with that other guy and that lady. Yesterday. I told him that lady wrote it alr and I will amend on top of it. Duh. Stupid princess. Confused what is Turnkey for fitout. And that other fellow said oh she from network she willl know. My ass la. . . 
Must be korect der engrish gramar eror so lbh senang to faham
Couldn’t even write the project brief properly. . She can’t even speak properly. Broken English all the way
I think dis one not true. Look at Ili
Lol. . Oh yes sure Ili. Who thought Kannan is from cp
At least that one know how to politik
Who thought ethics and compliance is in Cp
That is not right. It's Kanan. Kannan
Hahahaha. . Actually cp is the same. Cannot recognise what are bozos or talent
Hearing your friend bitch and talking to Zaha before she left abt YB i might hv to agree. Can u imagine that dude as line mgr
I will bully him
I cannot brain
I bully him now even. . Everytime he ask me a question I said I want coffee
Eh the line up mcm wizard of Oz.. wizard, scarecrow , dorothy (or maybe she's toto), lion and tin man.
Hehehhehe
Scarecrow joins Dorothy in the hope that The Wizard will give him a brain
Trying to do that series. . The mr that guye ms sleepy
Tin Woodman follows her to the Emerald City to get a heart. Richard Hargreaves. Sorry Roger Hargreaves. <Media omitted>. Sorry cannot no Mr.Bullshit. Or Mr.DunnoWhatTheFuckIsGoingOn
Lol
You deleted this message. Mr.InconsistentMsging
Mr:Dkdc. . MsBlur9
Aiyo Z how ar ?
MsHowAr. . MsHelpMe
Mr.Tulan who is often mistaken for Mr.Dkdc
that other guy was so sharp. . He asked me last night what was dkdc
Yeah lar u use that mysterious phrase after solar mtg that i had to explain as our private joke.. But yes he must hv written it down in his notebook as " _what is dkdc_ ? and underlined it
Coz u had that expression. . Where u don’t care. No, he had a good laugh. He is just sharp in general. He had a good laugh also when I was scolding that guy. . . . . . . 
that dude called me yesterday at 5pm told me that site survey visit w that company reviewer on Wed do i want to go?
Lol. . Think most are unclear when your last day is
Becoz seen as my pet project.
But at this point they should just connect with that other guy. . We spent a whole day in that company. that other guy has alr transitioned over
I consulted the cards. Even when reversed, the Magician is about making higher - and better - use of all of one's power. The reversal, however, can indicate that one is hesitant about making the necessary changes in order to use their power in a more spiritual and more effective manner. Consider what it is that you are afraid of. Is it that others may not like “the new you?” You’re right, they may not. However, this is no reason to not step into who you really want to - and are meant to - be. <Media omitted>. But then hor it also says.... Work: Receiving the Magician in reverse can indicate a resistance to needed change when it comes to your working life. The truth is that nothing stays the same forever, change and newness is a part of life. Don’t cling to the past.. Oh no. Open to any interpretation
U seriously consulted the cards ????. . Lol. Don’t cling to the past. Eff retail. Lol. What does this mean. . . . . . 
I dunno sounds like goobledygook
Who do u really want to be
I want to be a wizard!. Sorry Magician. <Media omitted>
Says who u really want to be or meant to be. . Means apa. Do u even know what / who u want to be
clearly (not)
Can u remember the time when u had the most job satisfaction
If i did i wld hv used the Datuk Lo connection long ago to boost myself there
Awarded for something? That u really worked hard for. . Not like rm200 for motogp type. When were u the happiest at work. Which job u actually look forward to coming to work every Monday. https://www.facebook.com/18468761129/posts/10156824227006130/. . . . . . . 
? Is this describing someone i shld know ?
Article implies it’s hard to detect if the person is high functioning
Ah.. Hmm...i guess there would be a lot of ppl who are just one pack of chain smoked ciggy-s, three beers and 1 roll of weed away from a complete and total nervous breakdown
??sounds like all of us
Yes hence my statement of *there would be a lot of ppl*. I mean u got pathat guy attack lady. weak heart condition dude. paranoid control freak madam
Who is this. . We hv vomiting boy
Sabrina?
Oh. . Who is this. Ruz?
Who is vomiting boy?. Yes Ruz
Cher
Oh. But is that stress related?
It is
Cannot stomach it anymore?
Prob. . Since Project Ocean started
Oh and Chang Hwee who apparently seems to be much more stable last yr vs what u told me
Only he and that dood Mahmud medically diagnosed with depression
And NFR kuli-kangs who are ready to burst into tears from sheer frustration and  overworkness
Few of them had. . Don’t u know there is a crying room. On your floor
No. Where?
The phone booth room next to the big meeting room
Always locked. Omg. Does it mean it is always occupied
Prob yes. . It’s the one near pantry
There is a big bowl there to collect the tears
Lol
To mix into the fuels
Prob less usage now. . All have grown out of it. Lol
Wah. I tried to ask Tess and Nst to do the I Not OK as HSSE Moment for Oct Granular planning but nobody wanted to. I even fwded the slides from glibal website. *Nat
Lol. . Why won’t they do it
Nobody wanted to talk abt Mental Health because they thought it would be crazy
Why. . I kinda like this subject. I took psychology as an elective last time
I dunno. Tess said not enuf time so let's ficus on 2019 Targets
Studying people more interesting than studying books
I took philosophy as my elective in my that doodg
I dropped it
I got A!
Too boring. . It made me more aware of people’s mental health
At least if Shell CP doesnt work out you can become a successful executive secretary. I think you've written at least 5 mthly summary notes for Aznan and Nirinder's that doodefit.
But I don’t want to be a secretary. . Enabler of dysfunction
Yes that will be yr epithet
Am in your neighbourhood. . Ttdi petronas kfc ahhaha
That is sad. Try the rojak outside. It's good
What ? It’s good kah. . Indian rojak
Yes pasembur
Hmmmm
Why u come so far?
Kindy reunion birthday party. . I am my son’s secretary
??
First lgbt birthday party
? The birthday person or the parents
Parents and guests. . Most I couldn’t tell if they were female or male
Wah.. Maybe they just ugly
Oh no it’s not. . Manly looking people with breasts la. Or womanly man
Maybe it's just that KFC chicken got too many hormone injections.. https://www.foodworldnews.com/articles/27224/20150717/chicken-hormones-kfc-this-chinese-man-grew-breasts-from-too-much-fried-chicken-photo.htm. gynecomastia, and it's basically the enlargement of breast tissue in men, and it is often caused when the female hormone estrogen and its malecounterpart testosterone don't balance out . I am taking yr advice and looking fwd instead getting sucked back in for another ~4-5mths.
exactly. . not good for u. they are all just thinking for themselves. nobody's thinking for u. . . . . . . . 
Or rather nobody is thinking.. Even if i were to do it , it wld really be becoz i enjoy working w that madam
but you'll still have to liaise with everyone. . and knowing retail. suddenly everthing, eh Zhi do la. eh zhi over to u. eh Zhi u know what, why u still ask. bla bla bla. . . . . . 
Yes. Can already feel me grinding my teeth imagining it.
yes. . and everyone will also start to 'use' u. don forget we have an OE team. catherine. suddenly NFR problem becomes your problem. i wont recommend it. if i was zahrin. . . . . 
Catherine is OE?
they should first undersatnd the problem. . get these OE people to be accountable. catherine is OE for NFR
Wah. They hv their own dedicated OE?
exactly. . she's too bogged down with operational issues. no time to look at end to end
I thought she was operations. I talked to her only once abt shop doc program data visualisations
yes. . she is NFR OE. CR Operation Excellence Manager
No OE for me is Organisational Effectiveness - it's an internal consulting arm that is part of the wider Group HR. We had to work with them for the 2015 upstream restructuring
yes. . that's how it should be. but that i would question. why do we have OE within NFR then. what have they been doing>?. Bringing in a consultant won’t resolve the issue. Tell zahrin, put that into everyone’s gpa. That’s what cp does. Then everyone will invest time and commit to it. The problem with retail is we keep outsourcing the problems. . 
<Media omitted>. Put what?. Oh btw that madam not Zahrin
Hehhehe. . Put OE in their gpa
It's more than OE clearly
Organisational Effectiveness...sounds like a fancy word for OE la
No it's very diff.. Look it up. On Sww
it's restructuring of roles? and in order to do that, need to see whether we're orgathat ladytionally effctive?. . but we are not. look at how lean Network is compared to NFR. jue did a clean up before. but it was only looking at contractors, and honestly i dont see any big changes. other than moving the roles to CBJ. . . . . . 
Ok. Spoke to that madam and said thanks but no thanks.
no thanks to apa
No thanks to coming back and helping for a while
haahhaha
I did my virtual bye bye wave.
lol. . omg. so abrupt. u should at least call her la. omg. want to tolak offer, u should call. . . . . . 
Spoke=talked to
lol
My EQ not so cacat
then your virtual bye bye wave?
Figure of speech. She is at East in Kuala Tganu  RED
i haven't met her u know
She met that madam
yeah. . i was suppose to help for the onboarding, but i had meeting with u guys
Will suggest u as an alternate for this reformasi job. that lady knows many things one. Really persistent and positive working attitude.. Will get ??done
hahahahhahahhaa. . i bukan orang retail. i dont think she'll be receptive
That's why u qualify.
i can only support. . someone in retail should be accountable
I will tell her abt non CP audit
i would say all the LT accountable. . AHAHHAHAHHAHAA. omg. u told her!!!!!!. . . . . . . . 
This one is Non Retail Audit. No lar.
i can only be a mole. . i can be her mole. i can give offline info saje. if it's towards the better of the orgathat ladytion. if she needs some balance and check and see if people are bullshitting her. . . . . . . 
She dont want mole. She wants major excavator and re landscaping service provider.
form a team le. . one general,. one deputy general. few sargeants. . . . . . . . 
All the skeletons and land mines buried
few soldiers. . solders= diggers. actually finance would be a good partner. make use of Cheng Yee. she suppose to be BUSINESS ASSURANCE. . . . . . . 
I told her same msg
we got all these fancy roles but not leveraging
Get Han Ern to push. He memang got passion for scolding idiots. Planners scared/fed up of him. But at end they follow. So good lor
but he cannot cover all angles. . he only economics. business assurance suppose to cover all the compliance issues
He got capacity. More than bunny rabbit face lady.. That one looks blur blur
i think improving. . everyone has to move from blur, to less blur and to non blur
Yes because clearly too much to ask for ppl to at least have 20/20 or know they need corrective glasses.. <Media omitted>
so blur ahaha. . Hv u ever worked with that lady. Seriously something wrong with shell
Limited interaction but my first impressions were as above...
Lol. . Sigh. i'm working with her now. so painful. the deli2go thing. i've basically drafted her project brief with yen. . . . . . 
that other guy said earlier she was trying to see if that company can project manage it on her behalf. Ok ma. Once no more hydrocarbon cars Retail Shell will be famous for cafes before it's sold off.. Like how Samsung used to do instant noodles.. Or Din Tai Fung was a cooking oil recycling company. Or 3M used to be a mining company making sandpaper.. But for now it's Deli GoAwaythat lady
and answering questions on behalf of her also, but this time i'm smarter already, i put a disclaimer to that other fellow that i'm answering on her behalf and this should rightfully be her job. . i only know this one. they hv a impression that it'll be slower via that company
Probably true
too many incompetent people in retail. . i hope they introduce more new external people. that guye profile pic ahhaha
You approve?. Does it hv your seal of approval
Yes .l.. . Just saw kc. He ask why u say goodbye
He remembers me?
Of coz he said
U say retail drove me away
Said u help him with something
Har?
Lubebay. . When u were an engineer
Omg. Yes long time ago. Loooong time ago
He said when he was in yee Kang’s role
Yes something like that
And your wife was cp. . He remembers your wife too
Hmmm. My wife limited interaction with him
He closer to u he said
But she was based kl for 1-2mths
Guy is like a superstar. . Everywhere I go ppl come and say hi
Funny.
This Salah Pintu story. . Bila the upgrade was done.. I think it’s a case of that company to OM eh please upgrade the site and create then use your layout. Barry keep us in check lol. Thank you barry much. . . . . . . 
I know. It's sooooo bodoh. U can say nvm let go only.. Not even NTI
I wouldn’t hv either. . U know me
But u worry what other bullshit is going on
that guy actually tried to get me to let go of the solar power pilot
That is hidden
The 2 agreements. . Think poor lady is struggling. I couldn’t. I won’t let him off the hook. . . . . . . . 
How lar. That one is not going to just go away
I submitted to legal alr. . Now waiting for legal to revise. Ooooo, let me remind him
How does he think it will magically fix itself? that other guy will settle it? that company will miraculously draft it?
Techthat guyally we could just leave it as is. . According to nadia. In our last meeting when u were in hk. That it is low risk. If we don’t rectify. . . . . . . 
How to collect the money
We can still collect. . Based on ers data
Anywaym
This was that guy’s takeaway ahhahahha. . I am the one who won’t let him off the hook
Refer above
U can’t dkdc
Why. Watch me.
U incapable. . Lol
(Actively not caring)
U can’t even let the Salah pintu go. . Lol
Omg. For them to try the oh Z say ok one.. Or Z tak bagi.
Lol. . Seeeere. U can’t do it
When everyone copied
U can’t do the full that guy. . Half saje
U know that guy completely lepas the GVR Data Security thing
It’s that other guy’s problem now Ma
It was put down to oh we did 2-3 pilots but that company nvr do close out of pilot specs so nobody knew to check.. This is how Kenny framed it.
Huhhhhhh. . There is an email trail ke. No le. Clearly they let warrantech do everything so they didn’t know enough to ask what was the consequence. . . . . . . . 
I dunno. that company now asking that other guy if got budget for Warrantech rectification/mobilisation to cabut the cable for the 50+ sites. Can charge AI 2019 budget ar?
It was ignorance. . What ??
Ini bullshit.
Retailer cannot sendiri Cabut ar
In the Dover FS pilot we did the whole link up w IT team
They didn’t liaise with IT
How come GVR pilot we happily bypass
That time IT kelam kabut
Mana check mana belens?
People all leaving. . Belens. Lol. Internally u were more collaborative. . . . . . . . 
Yeah. U want to see my melayu txting speak excel vba?
that guy was running around solo. . Omg
I wrote - u type proper buku teks bm it spits out slang speak
that madam must be scratching her head like wtf is wrong with everyone
I know what chatbot shld be called.. BRO-bot
Cakaprobot. . OMG
Hey bro
That’s a good one
Thanks bro
Bro-bot
Ok bros ape mcm
Chill la bro
Rilek la brader
Don’t worry bro. . I haven’t met that madam. I feel I should go say hi. Eh so when u are on sabbatical. Are u allowed to work. What u gonna do for money. . . . . .

Oh I didn’t know she is a divorcee. . My friend is a divorcee with 4 kids
See this cld be me at RM 180 per hr. _As a life coach, I am focused on unlocking the true potential of individuals to achieve their goals and elevate them to another level of growth._
Divorced the husband while pregnant with the 4th kid. . Omg. Sounds like nlp
Yes. More than NLP. That is just one of the tools to reprogram your thinking so you can unleash your full potential
What the hell does a life coach do. . Chiu. Sounds Anthony robbins thing izzit
Maybe i will do - Fix Your Life w MS Excel
I think the really strong people don’t need to write a book for affirmation. . So many silent warriors
Testimonials will be like - _my 10 year marriage was on the rocks but my god that spreadsheet fixed all my problems- i just needed to see it set out neatly in a washline diagram._
If we only knew more people in hardship I think we will realise our issues are trivial. . Lol. Z’s excel saved my life. I am mathematically sorted out. Did u actually buy the book?. And read it ?. . . . . . 
_I was broke, chrothat guyally depressed, without friends and tried everything from pills, electroshock therapy and psychiatrists. But everything changed when i learnt to index match my cells references and use array formulas! Thanks Z you saved my life and my files!_
I am such a skeptic. . Lol
I spoke to her at length and tried not to vomit. I used to know her from Taylor's College
She must hv gone to some course. . Those nlp type. Asiaworks
At one point she wrote bad poetry and we were collaborating on songs.
Yerrrrrr. . Wtf
But she really believes in this stuff.. Mind set matters
I had an ex colleague who was those life coach from asiaworks. . So she is so accessible to me
Psycho yrself to success / happiness / zen space
Everyday trying to lure me. . She gave up after 2 yrs. Said I was hard to crack. High aggressive not like siew yen. . . . . . . . 
Siew Yen got time to write sequel too
Too free la. . Her scope was shit. I work closely with her boss. Anne. . . . . . . . 
Being Happy in Tough Times. Sequel to Be Happy Now
I think there is a few quotes like that isn’t it
Vs other titles like _Still Happy ? Good._
I think people are disillusioned if they are happy all the time la. . Should be “ why so happy?”. “ why u so happy?”. “So happy for what “. But maybe she memang born like that. Did she turn happy positive after the divorce ?. . . . . . 
My book- _10 Secrets Of Sustainable Happiness : How YOU can Unlock Your Inner Mirth And Change The World 1 Bad Joke At A Time._. Got all ingredients.. Number/list check
10 secrets- how to say No
Secret check
How to say Fuck Off. . How to say “ so what “
This one trending
How to say “ not my problem”. . “ fix your own shit”. “I don’t know and I don’t care”. Secret ingredients to happiness. “I never receive any layout”. “I stupid “. . . . . .

Hmm.

Dunno. Anyway. Anywhere fine.
That’s what your friend said lol. . Indian - your Spice Village. <Media omitted>. Wat the toot. . . . . . . . 
There told you. Non CP is the new dept.
Really FML
At least he stop calling you dear
I was with your friend so I told a white lie that I was in a discussion. . Fml
Did he say thanks dearie
He said Roger that
Roger Dear?
I actually find him creepy
<Media omitted>
Wtf. . Lol. Actually he said “okay roger”. Means he calls me roger now. . . . . . . . 
Yes deer
Roger Toh that lady
You know why ppl say roger ?
Call me roger tomorrow. . Another random fact. Shoot
R=Received. So during WW1(? Or 2) ppl said Roger for received.. Like K for Kilo
Oh. . Tango. A friend told me this before. I can’t remember what he told me. . . . . . . . 
His name Tango?
Alpha. . Beta
Bravo
He explained the codes to me. . So do u say Roger that or Roger
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_word. Just wait - Ning will look for u again tmrw and u kena re- explain wat she has to do.
I met her few times alr. . Gosh
And then she will say ha this one non CP ma. You non CP dept right
She had a piece of work that Karen has handover to her months ago. . She keep asking me the same thing. She and that guy. It’s been what ? 4 months at least ???. Friday she asked me. Tuesday ask again. It’s been 4 months and she has done nothing. . . . . 
Hoping that by repeatedly asking, somehow magically you will say oh yes that one I do for you.
??. . I think she has poor absorption rate
I think this is general strategy for some ppl. I've seen that guy lar dance ard same techthat guyal / interface related topics repeatedly hoping that if we call big enough mtg someone will volunteer to settle for him.
Think he is also techthat guyally challenged
Also true for that weird  lady. The stupid stupid HSSE CoLo bullshit.
His gap is really decision making. . Part 2 alr - now that guy is going to use malaysia to further enhance the framework
U and I cld hv made the pack in 2 hrs. But we dragged it out 3 mths.
1 hour. . Lol
Use wat. Not even fully implemented
Use us to do a self check on the framework. . Now it’s gonna be risk based per activity. that weird  lady suppose to give him the sites to test
Another bullshit let's celeb success of half implemented initiative
( clip in , drive thru). . I pakat with that lady and that dood alr and came up with the list for easy sites to do. Masa meeting that weird  lady couldn’t give the sites list to that guy. So I gave them the list. Enabler is dysfunction. Enabler of dysfunction. I also wanted the meeting over and done with. that weird  lady team is really scared when she goes into this kinda meeting coz dunno what they end up having todo. . . . 
Like Queen Daenarys Targaryean , Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, etc etc  you are _Dear Roger of House Non CP, Enabler of Dysfunction, Facilitator of Persistent Incompetency and Hassler of Dimwits_. You win battle tapi lose the war
Why hassler. This is game of thrones right
True leadership comes w taking risks and allowing ppl to fail and learn their own lessons.
Yeah
Now Ning will ask u again tmrw
So I should say I don’t know
And then pull in Cheng Yi
I suppose to lousang with Cheng yee
And then both of them can ber blur together gether. And then ask that guy to join via telecon
Lol
And then say aiyo let's ask that guy too

Wat is his name ar
There was an expose. . Lim Ee van
Eevan what?. I dont eevan want to know
https://www.google.com.my/amp/s/interestingicloudstories.wordpress.com/2015/11/29/truth-about-tristupe-aka-ee-van/amp/. . Lame-o. Read it
Tldr. Look like rubbish
In summary. . He had an affair. Someone found his text messages. And exposed it. On Internet. . . . . . . 
Haiyah. Kaypoh
He sounded sleazy and kaypoh
Blackmail lar
But at work he likes to preach
Preach wat?
About being safe la being good la being that guye la being responsible la. . Intervene la. How shit marketing is la. How great sgw is la. I know this for a year alr. . . . . . . 
Mkting shit meh?
Whenever he preaches I remember this story. . I mean he doesn’t even work with them. But like to bash them with very minute issues
SGW good life.. Insulated
Not for kanthaa. . He hates India
True but that one is location punya pasal. And indian indians
At least he half Indian
He told me indians tell him his name spelling salah

Dunno but tastes bad
U know what is the recent 1 month drama on that coffee co
I tried. No milk?. Milk off spec?
Yen ask why flat white more expensive than latte
More milk mar. No?
Not really
Wait i know
It’s a perception. . Flat white seems more premium. Flat white has less milk
Actually ar best money must be from espresso
Americano. . It’s espresso tambah air
So little can charge so much
One month drama alr. . This is so lame
What is the drama. Wait i know
Flat white vs latte. . Yen ask why flat white more expensive. I told that weird  lady and that lady don’t bother to answer. Just get that coffee co to reply. But that made me check. . . . . . . 
that coffee co send them on uk coffee appreciation course
What is the difference. . Flat white is micro foamed milk. Latte - steamed milk plus foam milk
Isnt steamed=foamed?
Different. . Hv u ever made coffee. Like making lattes. Or flat whites. Bla bla. . . . . . . 
Nescafe gold blend only
ALAMAK

"hard work"
No meh. . Countless meetings wei
dunno whether it's worth celebrating something where this stuff generates zero that doodefit other than hitting our "Green" credentials.
It is lo. . If not do for what
that was what I was wondering. maybe would have been better if i spent all those manhours on ongoing and future NTI-s than with that silly Pram guy. the that power company thing apemcm ? jadi tak jadi ?
To be honest it was only 5% of my time. . Too slow this one
the other one le ? The internal nonsense - i.e the CleanTech punya offer
big bawse said park that aside
Ah well. All history now. Bet my that dude bro missing me now. Think that other guy must be tougher on the contract than I ever was.
Lol
Do that company know they will be rolled over or still hush hush?
I don’t think we are going to roll them off
Are they rolling the ball?. Roll roll roll. Or balls kena rolled
They had it easy with big bawse last week during annual business review. . Boss good mood. that other guy asked me to send u the good news on the that company. Send to Zhi tho...all his hardwork. A lot of people asking me how u are. Don’t know why they don’t just drop a note to u. that dood asked. that guy asked. . . . 
Spin some rumors
Oh. . that IT guy asked
Will be funny
But genuinely. . He asked what u are doing. He prob wanted to see if there is something u working on. I told him u still selling dvd. And lamp Berger. We particularly missed u yesterday. . . . . . 
<Media omitted>
Coz me and that IT guy had to goreng the that company writeup. . Me that IT guy and that guy. that guy on standby to check stuff for me. We did it until 9pm. I was telling that guy. If Zhi was here. . . . . . 
that guy goreng skill is bad.. He thinks it is good
U would hv spin it off in 10mins. . Yeahlo. But mine is too techthat guyal. So we sama sama bad. So lucky I had that IT guy. He actually really damn busy. But I wasn’t gonna throw it to him. So I sat 1.5hours writing it with him. . . . . 
He comes up w lamest dog ate my homework excuses sometimes
Lol. . that guy?
Yes
Zen Zhi. . Zennnnnn
big bawse on leave so we went ahead w agreement. Remember?
Eh your violin improved. . Now it’s doing the whole write up on how we got certification. After I am done. that guy texted me at 11.30pm. Said want to change some. ????????????. . . . . . 
Or the other one w DOSH where we didn't want to respond to a survey because of anti competition but she said that it was because we cannot answer on survey monkey due to confidentiality. *he
Lol. . Zennnnnn. that other guy clever. He outsource to that guy. Whatever that guy wanna claim glory. He gotta do it. . . . . . 
Good lor he can claim the full glory

The ers Guy. . Me and that other guy met him last week. Need to see him again today. When we query him on the report he said he will need to consult Zhi- I ask him to sort it out with you and that I will make sure Zhi charges you consulting fee. . . . . . . . 
That is just sad
Make sure he pay u. . I query where we got this guy. He look like a fucking bozo. Pay him to do menial work. . . . . . . . 
What is it I need to sort out? The fact that figures look suspiciously wrong?
He said he dunno how to do reporting. . Lol. Wtf
Either the 2016 date or the 2017 date is wrong.
It’s actually menial work that that other guy says even that poor fellow can do
*data. The 2017 KWH figures per site were generally half that of 2016...looks weird
That’s why. . Today we suppose to meet him. that other guy said the guy cannot be trusted le
Anyway I now know who to block on my phone.
Eh. . Make money. Hehehhe
So how I thought global ppl wanted not just 2017 but also the 2018 data before the end of the fish quarter. *first
I know
About the global ppl or ???
They want all the data. . that other guy working on this
I think need to get S&O involved oledi. Maybe ask Retailer to fill in via a web app (We must already hv something like this for WetStock) and as incentive if they submit then got chance to participate in a lucky draw to get Solar Panels installed? ;-). Nobody seems to hv this info - ERS also cannot make it and TNB also cannot compile for us.
